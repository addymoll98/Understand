Guarantee exception safety \nProper handling of errors and exceptional situations is essential for the continued correct \noperation of software. The preferred mechanism for reporting errors in a C++ program is \nexceptions rather than error codes. A number of core language facilities, including \ndynamic_cast, operator new(), and typeid, report failures by throwing exceptions. In \naddition, the C++ standard library makes heavy use of exceptions to report several different kinds \nof failures. Few C++ programs manage to avoid using some of these facilities. Consequently, the \nvast majority of C++ programs must be prepared for exceptions to occur and must handle each \nappropriately. (See ERR51-CPP. Handle all exceptions.) \nBecause exceptions introduce code paths into a program, it is important to consider the effects of \ncode taking such paths and to avoid any undesirable effects that might arise otherwise. Some such \neffects include failure to release an acquired resource, thereby introducing a leak, and failure to \nreestablish a class invariant after a partial update to an object or even a partial object update while \nmaintaining all invariants. Code that avoids any such undesirable effects is said to be exception \nsafe. \nBased on the preceding effects, the following table distinguishes three kinds of exception safety \nguarantees from most to least desired. \nGuarantee \nDescription \nExample \nStrong \n \nThe strong exception safety guarantee is a property of an operation \nsuch that, in addition to satisfying the basic exception safety \nguarantee, if the operation terminates by raising an exception, it has \nno observable effects on program state. \nStrong Exception Safety \n \nBasic \n \nThe basic exception safety guarantee is a property of an operation \nsuch that, if the operation terminates by raising an exception, it \npreserves program state invariants and prevents resource leaks. \nBasic Exception Safety \n \nNone \n \nCode that provides neither the strong nor basic exception safety \nguarantee is not exception safe. \nNo Exception Safety \n \nCode that guarantees strong exception safety also guarantees basic exception safety. \nBecause all exceptions thrown in an application must be handled, in compliance with ERR50-\nCPP. Do not abruptly terminate the program, it is critical that thrown exceptions do not leave the \nprogram in an indeterminate state where invariants are violated. That is, the program must provide \nbasic exception safety for all invariants and may choose to provide strong exception safety for \nsome invariants. Whether exception handling is used to control the termination of the program or \nto recover from an exceptional situation, a violated invariant leaves the program in a state where \ngraceful continued execution is likely to introduce security vulnerabilities. Thus, code that \nprovides no exception safety guarantee is unsafe and must be considered defective. \nExceptions and Error Handling (ERR) - ERR56-CPP.

The \nimplicit invariants of the class are that the array member is a valid (possibly null) pointer and \nthat the nElems member stores the number of elements in the array pointed to by array. The \nfunction deallocates array and assigns the element counter, nElems, before allocating a new \nblock of memory for the copy. As a result, if the new expression throws an exception, the \nfunction will have modified the state of both member variables in a way that violates the implicit \ninvariants of the class. Consequently, such an object is in an indeterminate state and any operation \non it, including its destruction, results in undefined behavior. \n#include <cstring> \n \nclass IntArray { \n  int *array; \n  std::size_t nElems; \npublic: \n  // ... \n \n  ~IntArray() { \n    delete[] array; \n  } \n \n  IntArray(const IntArray& that); // nontrivial copy constructor \n  IntArray& operator=(const IntArray &rhs) { \n    if (this != &rhs) { \n      delete[] array; \n      array = nullptr; \n      nElems = rhs.nElems; \n      if (nElems) { \n        array = new int[nElems]; \n        std::memcpy(array, rhs.array, nElems * sizeof(*array)); \n      } \n    } \n    return *this; \n  } \n \n  // ... \n}; \nExceptions and Error Handling (ERR) - ERR56-CPP.

The function allocates new storage for the copy before changing the state of the object. \nOnly after the allocation succeeds does the function proceed to change the state of the object. In \naddition, by copying the array to the newly allocated storage before deallocating the existing \narray, the function avoids the test for self-assignment, which improves the performance of the \ncode in the common case [Sutter 2004]. \n#include <cstring> \n \nclass IntArray { \n  int *array; \n  std::size_t nElems; \npublic: \n  // ... \n \n  ~IntArray() { \n    delete[] array; \n  } \n \n  IntArray(const IntArray& that); // nontrivial copy constructor \n \n  IntArray& operator=(const IntArray &rhs) { \n    int *tmp = nullptr; \n    if (rhs.nElems) { \n      tmp = new int[rhs.nElems]; \n      std::memcpy(tmp, rhs.array, rhs.nElems * sizeof(*array)); \n    } \n    delete[] array; \n    array = tmp; \n    nElems = rhs.nElems; \n    return *this; \n  } \n \n  // ... \n}; \n9.7.3 \nRisk Assessment \nCode that is not exception safe typically leads to resource leaks, causes the program to be left in \nan inconsistent or unexpected state, and ultimately results in undefined behavior at some point \nafter the first exception is thrown. \nRule \nSeverity \nLikelihood \nRemediation Cost \nPriority \nLevel \nERR56-CPP \nHigh \nLikely \nHigh \nP9 \nL2 \nExceptions and Error Handling (ERR) - ERR56-CPP.

Obey the one-definition rule \nNontrivial C++ programs are generally divided into multiple translation units that are later linked \ntogether to form an executable. To support such a model, C++ restricts named object definitions \nto ensure that linking will behave deterministically by requiring a single definition for an object \nacross all translation units. This model is called the one-definition rule (ODR), which is defined \nby the C++ Standard, [basic.def.odr] in paragraph 4 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014]: \nEvery program shall contain exactly one definition of every non-inline function or variable \nthat is odr-used in that program; no diagnostic required. The definition can appear \nexplicitly in the program, it can be found in the standard or a user-defined library, or \n(when appropriate) it is implicitly defined. An inline function shall be defined in every \ntranslation unit in which it is odr-used. \nThe most common approach to multitranslation unit compilation involves declarations residing in \na header file that is subsequently made available to a source file via #include. These \ndeclarations are often also definitions, such as class and function template definitions. This \napproach is allowed by an exception defined in paragraph 6, which, in part, states the following: \nThere can be more than one definition of a class type, enumeration type, inline function \nwith external linkage, class template, non-static function template, static data member of \na class template, member function of a class template, or template specialization for \nwhich some template parameters are not specified in a program provided that each \ndefinition appears in a different translation unit, and provided the definitions satisfy the \nfollowing requirements. Given such an entity named D defined in more than one \ntranslation unit.... \nIf the definitions of D satisfy all these requirements, then the program shall behave as if \nthere were a single definition of D. If the definitions of D do not satisfy these \nrequirements, then the behavior is undefined. \nThe requirements specified by paragraph 6 essentially state that that two definitions must be \nidentical (not simply equivalent). Consequently, a definition introduced in two separate translation \nunits by an #include directive generally will not violate the ODR because the definitions are \nidentical in both translation units. \nHowever, it is possible to violate the ODR of a definition introduced via #include using block \nlanguage linkage specifications, vendor-specific language extensions, and so on. A more likely \nscenario for ODR violations is that accidental definitions of differing objects will exist in different \ntranslation units. \nDo not violate the one-definition rule; violations result in undefined behavior. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

Although the two definitions are functionally equivalent (they both \ndefine a class named S with a single, public, nonstatic data member int a), they are not defined \nusing the same sequence of tokens.

If the programmer intends for the same \nclass definition to be visible in both translation units because of common usage, the solution is to \nuse a header file to introduce the object into both translation units, as shown in this compliant \nsolution. \n// S.h \nstruct S { \n  int a; \n}; \n \n// a.cpp \n#include "S.h" \n  \n// b.cpp \n#include "S.h" \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

However, one of the translation units uses an implementation-defined #pragma that \nis supported by Microsoft Visual Studio to specify structure field alignment requirements. \nConsequently, the two class definitions may have differing layouts in each translation unit, which \nis a violation of the ODR. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

Consequently, when init_s() initializes the data members of s, it may result in a \nbuffer overrun. \nFor more information on the behavior of #pragma pack, see the vendor documentation for \nyour implementation, such as Microsoft Visual Studio or GCC. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

Because f() is declared as an inline function, the \ndefinition of f() must be identical in all translation units. However, each translation unit has a \nunique instance of n, resulting in a violation of the ODR. \nconst int n = 42; \n \nint g(const int &lhs, const int &rhs); \n  \ninline int f(int k) { \n  return g(k, n); \n} \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

This solution is compliant but it is not ideal. It may not be possible (or \ndesirable) to modify the signature of g(), such as if g() represented std::max() from \n<algorithm>. Also, because of the differing linkage used by n and f(), accidental violations \nof the ODR are still likely if the definition of f() is modified to odr-use n. \nconst int n = 42; \n \nint g(int lhs, int rhs); \n  \ninline int f(int k) { \n  return g(k, n); \n} \n2.11.8 Compliant Solution \nIn this compliant solution, the constant object n is replaced with an enumerator of the same name. \nNamed enumerations defined at namespace scope have the same linkage as the namespace they \nare contained in. The global namespace has external linkage, so the definition of the named \nenumeration and its contained enumerators also have external linkage.

As shown in “Support for Whole-Program Analysis and the Verification of the \nOne-Definition Rule in C++” [Quinlan 2006], failing to enforce the ODR enables a virtual \nfunction pointer attack known as the VPTR exploit. In this exploit, an object’s virtual function \ntable is corrupted so that calling a virtual function on the object results in malicious code being \nexecuted. See the paper by Quinlan and colleagues for more details.

Do not pass a nonstandard-layout type object across \nexecution boundaries \nStandard-layout types can be used to communicate with code written in other programming \nlanguages, as the layout of the type is strictly specified. The C++ Standard, [class], paragraph 7 \n[ISO/IEC 14882-2014], defines a standard-layout class as a class that \n• \ndoes not have virtual functions, \n• \nhas the same access control for all nonstatic data members, \n• \nhas no base classes of the same type as the first nonstatic data member, \n• \nhas nonstatic data members declared in only one class within the class hierarchy, and  \n• \nrecursively, does not have nonstatic data members of nonstandard-layout type. \nAn execution boundary is the delimitation between code compiled by differing compilers, \nincluding different versions of a compiler produced by the same vendor. For instance, a function \nmay be declared in a header file but defined in a library that is loaded at runtime. The execution \nboundary exists between the call site in the executable and the function implementation in the \nlibrary. Such boundaries are also called ABI (application binary interface) boundaries because \nthey relate to the interoperability of application binaries. \nDo not make any assumptions about the specific layout of objects with nonstandard-layout types. \nFor objects compiled by one compiler that are referenced by code compiled by a different \ncompiler, such assumptions cause correctness and portability concerns. The layout of the object \ngenerated by the first compiler is not guaranteed to be identical to the layout generated by the \nsecond compiler, even if both compilers are conforming C++ implementations. However, some \nimplementations may document binary compatibility guarantees that can be relied on for passing \nnonstandard-layout objects between execution boundaries. \nA special instance of this guidance involves non-C++ code compiled by a different compiler, such \nas C standard library implementations that are exposed via the C++ standard library. C standard \nlibrary functions are exposed with C++ signatures, and the type system frequently assists in \nensuring that types match appropriately. This process disallows passing a pointer to a C++ object \nto a function expecting a char * without additional work to suppress the type mismatch. \nHowever, some C standard library functions accept a void * for which any C++ pointer type \nwill suffice. Passing a pointer to a nonstandard-layout type in this situation results in \nindeterminate behavior because it depends on the behavior of the other language as well as on the \nlayout of the given object. For more information, see rule EXP56-CPP. Do not call a function \nwith a mismatched language linkage. \nPass a nonstandard-layout type object across execution boundaries only when both sides of the \nexecution boundary adhere to the same ABI. This is permissible if the same version of a compiler \nis used to compile both sides of the execution boundary, if the compiler used to compile both \nsides of the execution boundary is ABI-compatible across multiple versions, or if the differing \ncompilers document that they adhere to the same ABI. \nExpressions (EXP) - EXP60-CPP.

The application \ncreates an instance of an object of this type, then passes a reference to the object to a function \ndefined by the library, crossing the execution boundary. Because the layout is not guaranteed to \nbe compatible across the boundary, this results in unexpected behavior. \n// library.h \nstruct S { \n  virtual void f() { /* ... */ } \n}; \n \nvoid func(S &s); // Implemented by the library, calls S::f() \n \n// application.cpp \n#include "library.h" \n \nvoid g() { \n  S s; \n  func(s); \n} \nThis example would be compliant if the library and the application conformed to the same ABI, \neither explicitly through vendor documentation or implicitly by virtue of using the same compiler \nversion to compile both. \n3.11.2 Compliant Solution \nBecause the library and application do not conform to the same ABI, this compliant solution \nmodifies the library and application to work with a standard-layout type.

A signal handler must be a plain old function \nThe C++ Standard, [support.runtime], paragraph 10 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the following: \nThe common subset of the C and C++ languages consists of all declarations, definitions, \nand expressions that may appear in a well formed C++ program and also in a \nconforming C program. A POF (“plain old function”) is a function that uses only features \nfrom this common subset, and that does not directly or indirectly use any function that is \nnot a POF, except that it may use plain lock-free atomic operations. A plain lock-free \natomic operation is an invocation of a function f from Clause 29, such that f is not a \nmember function, and either f is the function atomic_is_lock_free, or for every \natomic argument A passed to f, atomic_is_lock_free(A) yields true. All signal \nhandlers shall have C linkage. The behavior of any function other than a POF used as a \nsignal handler in a C++ program is implementation-defined.228 \nFootnote 228 states the following: \nIn particular, a signal handler using exception handling is very likely to have problems. \nAlso, invoking std::exit may cause destruction of objects, including those of the \nstandard library implementation, which, in general, yields undefined behavior in a signal \nhandler. \nIf your signal handler is not a plain old function, then the behavior of a call to it in response to a \nsignal is implementation-defined, at best, and is likely to result in undefined behavior. All signal \nhandlers must meet the definition of a plain old function. In addition to the restrictions placed on \nsignal handlers in a C program, this definition also prohibits the use of features that exist in C++ \nbut not in C (such as non-POD [non–plain old data] objects and exceptions). This includes \nindirect use of such features through function calls.  \n12.5.1 Noncompliant Code Example \nIn this noncompliant code example, the signal handler is declared as a static function. \nHowever, since all signal handler functions must have C language linkage, and C++ is the default \nlanguage linkage for functions in C++, calling the signal handler results in undefined behavior. \n#include <csignal> \n \nstatic void sig_handler(int sig) { \n  // Implementation details elided. \n} \n \nvoid install_signal_handler() { \n  if (SIG_ERR == std::signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler)) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \nMiscellaneous (MSC) - MSC54-CPP.

As a \nconsequence of declaring the signal handler with C language linkage, the signal handler will have \nexternal linkage rather than internal linkage. \n#include <csignal> \n  \nextern "C" void sig_handler(int sig) { \n  // Implementation details elided. \n} \n \nvoid install_signal_handler() { \n  if (SIG_ERR == std::signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler)) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \n12.5.3 Noncompliant Code Example \nIn this noncompliant code example, a signal handler calls a function that allows exceptions, and it \nattempts to handle any exceptions thrown. Because exceptions are not part of the common subset \nof C and C++ features, this example results in implementation-defined behavior. However, it is \nunlikely that the implementation’s behavior will be suitable. For instance, on a stack-based \narchitecture where a signal is generated asynchronously (instead of as a result of a call to \nstd:abort() or std::raise()), it is possible that the stack frame is not properly \ninitialized, causing stack tracing to be unreliable and preventing the exception from being caught \nproperly. \n#include <csignal> \n \nstatic void g() noexcept(false); \n \nextern "C" void sig_handler(int sig) { \n  try { \n    g(); \n  } catch (...) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \n \nvoid install_signal_handler() { \n  if (SIG_ERR == std::signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler)) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \nMiscellaneous (MSC) - MSC54-CPP.

Even if g() were implemented such that it handled all exceptions and was \nmarked noexcept(true), it would still be noncompliant to call g()from a signal handler \nbecause g() would still use a feature that is not a part of the common subset of C and C++ \nfeatures allowed by a signal handler. Therefore, this compliant solution removes the call to g() \nfrom the signal handler and instead polls a variable of type volatile sig_atomic_t \nperiodically; if the variable is set to 1 in the signal handler, then g() is called to respond to the \nsignal. \n#include <csignal> \n \nvolatile sig_atomic_t signal_flag = 0; \nstatic void g() noexcept(false); \n \nextern "C" void sig_handler(int sig) { \n  signal_flag = 1; \n} \n \nvoid install_signal_handler() { \n  if (SIG_ERR == std::signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler)) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \n \n// Called periodically to poll the signal flag. \nvoid poll_signal_flag() { \n  if (signal_flag == 1) { \n    signal_flag = 0; \n    try { \n      g(); \n    } catch(...) { \n      // Handle error \n    } \n  } \n} \nMiscellaneous (MSC) - MSC54-CPP.

Given the number of features that exist in C++ that do not \nalso exist in C, the consequences that arise from failure to comply with this rule can range from \nbenign (harmless) behavior to abnormal program termination, or even arbitrary code execution. \nRule \nSeverity \nLikelihood \nRemediation Cost \nPriority \nLevel \nMSC54-CPP \nHigh \nProbable \nHigh \nP6 \nL2 \n12.5.6 Related Guidelines \nSEI CERT C Coding Standard \nSIG30-C.

Do not cast to an out-of-range enumeration value \nEnumerations in C++ come in two forms: scoped enumerations in which the underlying type is \nfixed and unscoped enumerations in which the underlying type may or may not be fixed. The \nrange of values that can be represented by either form of enumeration may include enumerator \nvalues not specified by the enumeration itself. The range of valid enumeration values for an \nenumeration type is defined by the C++ Standard, [dcl.enum], in paragraph 8 [ISO/IEC 14882-\n2014]: \nFor an enumeration whose underlying type is fixed, the values of the enumeration are \nthe values of the underlying type. Otherwise, for an enumeration where emin is the \nsmallest enumerator and emax is the largest, the values of the enumeration are the \nvalues in the range bmin to bmax, defined as follows: Let K be 1 for a two’s complement \nrepresentation and 0 for a one’s complement or sign-magnitude representation. bmax is \nthe smallest value greater than or equal to max(|emin| − K, |emax|) and equal to 2M − 1, \nwhere M is a non-negative integer. bmin is zero if emin is non-negative and −(bmax + K) \notherwise. The size of the smallest bit-field large enough to hold all the values of the \nenumeration type is max(M, 1) if bmin is zero and M + 1 otherwise. It is possible to define \nan enumeration that has values not defined by any of its enumerators. If the enumerator-\nlist is empty, the values of the enumeration are as if the enumeration had a single \nenumerator with value 0. \nThe C++ Standard, [expr.static.cast], paragraph 10, states the following: \nA value of integral or enumeration type can be explicitly converted to an enumeration \ntype. The value is unchanged if the original value is within the range of the enumeration \nvalues (7.2). Otherwise, the resulting value is unspecified (and might not be in that \nrange). A value of floating-point type can also be explicitly converted to an enumeration \ntype. The resulting value is the same as converting the original value to the underlying \ntype of the enumeration (4.9), and subsequently to the enumeration type. \nTo avoid operating on unspecified values, the arithmetic value being cast must be within the range \nof values the enumeration can represent. When dynamically checking for out-of-range values, \nchecking must be performed before the cast expression. \nIntegers (INT) - INT50-CPP.

However, it is doing so after casting to the enumeration type, \nwhich may not be able to represent the given integer value. On a two’s complement system, the \nvalid range of values that can be represented by EnumType are [0..3], so if a value outside of that \nrange were passed to f(), the cast to EnumType would result in an unspecified value, and using \nthat value within the if statement results in unspecified behavior. \nenum EnumType { \n  First, \n  Second, \n  Third \n}; \n \nvoid f(int intVar) { \n  EnumType enumVar = static_cast<EnumType>(intVar); \n \n  if (enumVar < First || enumVar > Third) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \n4.1.2 \nCompliant Solution (Bounds Checking) \nThis compliant solution checks that the value can be represented by the enumeration type before \nperforming the conversion to guarantee the conversion does not result in an unspecified value. It \ndoes this by restricting the converted value to one for which there is a specific enumerator value. \nenum EnumType { \n  First, \n  Second, \n  Third \n}; \n \nvoid f(int intVar) { \n  if (intVar < First || intVar > Third) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n  EnumType enumVar = static_cast<EnumType>(intVar); \n} \n \nIntegers (INT) - INT50-CPP.

It \ndoes not restrict the converted value to one for which there is a specific enumerator value, but it \ncould do so as shown in the previous compliant solution. \nenum class EnumType { \n  First, \n  Second, \n  Third \n}; \n \nvoid f(int intVar) { \n  EnumType enumVar = static_cast<EnumType>(intVar); \n} \n4.1.4 \nCompliant Solution (Fixed Unscoped Enumeration) \nSimilar to the previous compliant solution, this compliant solution uses an unscoped enumeration \nbut provides a fixed underlying int type allowing any value from the parameter to be converted \nto a valid enumeration value. \nenum EnumType : int { \n  First, \n  Second, \n  Third \n}; \n \nvoid f(int intVar) { \n  EnumType enumVar = static_cast<EnumType>(intVar); \n} \nAlthough similar to the previous compliant solution, this compliant solution differs from the \nnoncompliant code example in the way the enumerator values are expressed in code and which \nimplicit conversions are allowed. The previous compliant solution requires a nested name \nspecifier to identify the enumerator (for example, EnumType::First) and will not implicitly \nconvert the enumerator value to int. As with the noncompliant code example, this compliant \nsolution does not allow a nested name specifier and will implicitly convert the enumerator value \nto int. \nIntegers (INT) - INT50-CPP.

Do not access a cv-qualified object through a cv-\nunqualified type \nThe C++ Standard, [dcl.type.cv], paragraph 4 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the following: \nExcept that any class member declared mutable can be modified, any attempt to \nmodify a const object during its lifetime results in undefined behavior. \nSimilarly, paragraph 6 states the following: \nWhat constitutes an access to an object that has volatile-qualified type is \nimplementation-defined. If an attempt is made to refer to an object defined with a \nvolatile-qualified type through the use of a glvalue with a non-volatile-qualified type, the \nprogram behavior is undefined. \nDo not cast away a const qualification to attempt to modify the resulting object. The const \nqualifier implies that the API designer does not intend for that object to be modified despite the \npossibility it may be modifiable. Do not cast away a volatile qualification; the volatile \nqualifier implies that the API designer intends the object to be accessed in ways unknown to the \ncompiler, and any access of the volatile object results in undefined behavior. \n3.6.1 \nNoncompliant Code Example \nIn this noncompliant code example, the function g() is passed a const int &, which is then \ncast to an int & and modified.

However, it is always preferable to modify the API \nto be const-correct when possible.

Do not alternately input and output from a file stream \nwithout an intervening positioning call \nThe C++ Standard, [filebuf], paragraph 2 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the following: \nThe restrictions on reading and writing a sequence controlled by an object of class \nbasic_filebuf<charT, traits> are the same as for reading and writing with the \nStandard C library FILEs. \nThe C Standard, subclause 7.19.5.3, paragraph 6 [ISO/IEC 9899:1999], places the following \nrestrictions on FILE objects opened for both reading and writing: \nWhen a file is opened with update mode . . ., both input and output may be performed on \nthe associated stream. However, output shall not be directly followed by input without an \nintervening call to the fflush function or to a file positioning function (fseek, \nfsetpos, or rewind), and input shall not be directly followed by output without an \nintervening call to a file positioning function, unless the input operation encounters end-\nof-file. \nConsequently, the following scenarios can result in undefined behavior: \n• \nReceiving input from a stream directly following an output to that stream without an \nintervening call to std::basic_filebuf<T>::seekoff() if the file is not at end-of-\nfile \n• \nOutputting to a stream after receiving input from that stream without a call to \nstd::basic_filebuf<T>::seekoff() if the file is not at end-of-file \nNo other std::basic_filebuf<T> function guarantees behavior as if a call were made to a \nstandard C library file-positioning function, or std::fflush(). \nCalling std::basic_ostream<T>::seekp() or \nstd::basic_istream<T>::seekg() eventually results in a call to \nstd::basic_filebuf<T>::seekoff() for file stream positioning.

8.15.1.2.  The software developer should document in the Nuclear Surety Evaluation 
source code that is untestable due to the nature of the code, error handling in the code or 
low-level source code the software developer designed for very specific scenarios. 
8.15.1.3.  The preferred unused code analysis is statement coverage testing. This form of 
dynamic analysis is a conclusive method for proving that software does not contain unused 
code. 
8.15.1.4.  Fuzzing is also a recommended tool to ensure coverage-testing focuses only on 
necessary sections of code. For Complex Programmable Logic Devices and Application 
Specific Integrated Circuits, the software or build process disables functions in intellectual 
property sections at interface boundaries. 
8.15.1.5.  The software developer may use synthesis optimization to eliminate functions 
that the software cannot reach if this option is available. This requirement applies to spare 
gates and unused gate array cells only so far as to require the software developer to wire 
these inactive in layout.

RESPONSE: Given this context from the CERT C++ documentation, see if any of the CERT C++ requirements are related to the provided AFMAN requirement:\n\n2.11 DCL60-CPP. Obey the one-definition rule \nNontrivial C++ programs are generally divided into multiple translation units that are later linked \ntogether to form an executable. To support such a model, C++ restricts named object definitions \nto ensure that linking will behave deterministically by requiring a single definition for an object \nacross all translation units. This model is called the one-definition rule (ODR), which is defined \nby the C++ Standard, [basic.def.odr] in paragraph 4 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014]: \nEvery program shall contain exactly one definition of every non-inline function or variable \nthat is odr-used in that program; no diagnostic required. The definition can appear \nexplicitly in the program, it can be found in the standard or a user-defined library, or \n(when appropriate) it is implicitly defined. An inline function shall be defined in every \ntranslation unit in which it is odr-used. \nThe most common approach to multitranslation unit compilation involves declarations residing in \na header file that is subsequently made available to a source file via #include. These \ndeclarations are often also definitions, such as class and function template definitions. This \napproach is allowed by an exception defined in paragraph 6, which, in part, states the following: \nThere can be more than one definition of a class type, enumeration type, inline function \nwith external linkage, class template, non-static function template, static data member of \na class template, member function of a class template, or template specialization for \nwhich some template parameters are not specified in a program provided that each \ndefinition appears in a different translation unit, and provided the definitions satisfy the \nfollowing requirements. Given such an entity named D defined in more than one \ntranslation unit.... \nIf the definitions of D satisfy all these requirements, then the program shall behave as if \nthere were a single definition of D. If the definitions of D do not satisfy these \nrequirements, then the behavior is undefined. \nThe requirements specified by paragraph 6 essentially state that that two definitions must be \nidentical (not simply equivalent). Consequently, a definition introduced in two separate translation \nunits by an #include directive generally will not violate the ODR because the definitions are \nidentical in both translation units. \nHowever, it is possible to violate the ODR of a definition introduced via #include using block \nlanguage linkage specifications, vendor-specific language extensions, and so on. A more likely \nscenario for ODR violations is that accidental definitions of differing objects will exist in different \ntranslation units. \nDo not violate the one-definition rule; violations result in undefined behavior. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

Although the two definitions are functionally equivalent (they both \ndefine a class named S with a single, public, nonstatic data member int a), they are not defined \nusing the same sequence of tokens.

If the programmer intends for the same \nclass definition to be visible in both translation units because of common usage, the solution is to \nuse a header file to introduce the object into both translation units, as shown in this compliant \nsolution. \n// S.h \nstruct S { \n  int a; \n}; \n \n// a.cpp \n#include "S.h" \n  \n// b.cpp \n#include "S.h" \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

However, one of the translation units uses an implementation-defined #pragma that \nis supported by Microsoft Visual Studio to specify structure field alignment requirements. \nConsequently, the two class definitions may have differing layouts in each translation unit, which \nis a violation of the ODR. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

Consequently, when init_s() initializes the data members of s, it may result in a \nbuffer overrun. \nFor more information on the behavior of #pragma pack, see the vendor documentation for \nyour implementation, such as Microsoft Visual Studio or GCC. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

Because f() is declared as an inline function, the \ndefinition of f() must be identical in all translation units. However, each translation unit has a \nunique instance of n, resulting in a violation of the ODR. \nconst int n = 42; \n \nint g(const int &lhs, const int &rhs); \n  \ninline int f(int k) { \n  return g(k, n); \n} \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

This solution is compliant but it is not ideal. It may not be possible (or \ndesirable) to modify the signature of g(), such as if g() represented std::max() from \n<algorithm>. Also, because of the differing linkage used by n and f(), accidental violations \nof the ODR are still likely if the definition of f() is modified to odr-use n. \nconst int n = 42; \n \nint g(int lhs, int rhs); \n  \ninline int f(int k) { \n  return g(k, n); \n} \n2.11.8 Compliant Solution \nIn this compliant solution, the constant object n is replaced with an enumerator of the same name. \nNamed enumerations defined at namespace scope have the same linkage as the namespace they \nare contained in. The global namespace has external linkage, so the definition of the named \nenumeration and its contained enumerators also have external linkage. Although less aesthetically \npleasing, this compliant solution does not suffer from the same maintenance burdens of the \nprevious code because n and f() have the same linkage. \nenum Constants { \n  N = 42 \n}; \n \nint g(const int &lhs, const int &rhs); \n  \ninline int f(int k) { \n  return g(k, N); \n} \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

As shown in “Support for Whole-Program Analysis and the Verification of the \nOne-Definition Rule in C++” [Quinlan 2006], failing to enforce the ODR enables a virtual \nfunction pointer attack known as the VPTR exploit. In this exploit, an object’s virtual function \ntable is corrupted so that calling a virtual function on the object results in malicious code being \nexecuted.

Guarantee exception safety \nProper handling of errors and exceptional situations is essential for the continued correct \noperation of software. The preferred mechanism for reporting errors in a C++ program is \nexceptions rather than error codes. A number of core language facilities, including \ndynamic_cast, operator new(), and typeid, report failures by throwing exceptions. In \naddition, the C++ standard library makes heavy use of exceptions to report several different kinds \nof failures. Few C++ programs manage to avoid using some of these facilities. Consequently, the \nvast majority of C++ programs must be prepared for exceptions to occur and must handle each \nappropriately. (See ERR51-CPP. Handle all exceptions.) \nBecause exceptions introduce code paths into a program, it is important to consider the effects of \ncode taking such paths and to avoid any undesirable effects that might arise otherwise. Some such \neffects include failure to release an acquired resource, thereby introducing a leak, and failure to \nreestablish a class invariant after a partial update to an object or even a partial object update while \nmaintaining all invariants. Code that avoids any such undesirable effects is said to be exception \nsafe. \nBased on the preceding effects, the following table distinguishes three kinds of exception safety \nguarantees from most to least desired. \nGuarantee \nDescription \nExample \nStrong \n \nThe strong exception safety guarantee is a property of an operation \nsuch that, in addition to satisfying the basic exception safety \nguarantee, if the operation terminates by raising an exception, it has \nno observable effects on program state. \nStrong Exception Safety \n \nBasic \n \nThe basic exception safety guarantee is a property of an operation \nsuch that, if the operation terminates by raising an exception, it \npreserves program state invariants and prevents resource leaks. \nBasic Exception Safety \n \nNone \n \nCode that provides neither the strong nor basic exception safety \nguarantee is not exception safe. \nNo Exception Safety \n \nCode that guarantees strong exception safety also guarantees basic exception safety. \nBecause all exceptions thrown in an application must be handled, in compliance with ERR50-\nCPP. Do not abruptly terminate the program, it is critical that thrown exceptions do not leave the \nprogram in an indeterminate state where invariants are violated. That is, the program must provide \nbasic exception safety for all invariants and may choose to provide strong exception safety for \nsome invariants. Whether exception handling is used to control the termination of the program or \nto recover from an exceptional situation, a violated invariant leaves the program in a state where \ngraceful continued execution is likely to introduce security vulnerabilities. Thus, code that \nprovides no exception safety guarantee is unsafe and must be considered defective. \nExceptions and Error Handling (ERR) - ERR56-CPP.

The \nimplicit invariants of the class are that the array member is a valid (possibly null) pointer and \nthat the nElems member stores the number of elements in the array pointed to by array. The \nfunction deallocates array and assigns the element counter, nElems, before allocating a new \nblock of memory for the copy. As a result, if the new expression throws an exception, the \nfunction will have modified the state of both member variables in a way that violates the implicit \ninvariants of the class. Consequently, such an object is in an indeterminate state and any operation \non it, including its destruction, results in undefined behavior. \n#include <cstring> \n \nclass IntArray { \n  int *array; \n  std::size_t nElems; \npublic: \n  // ... \n \n  ~IntArray() { \n    delete[] array; \n  } \n \n  IntArray(const IntArray& that); // nontrivial copy constructor \n  IntArray& operator=(const IntArray &rhs) { \n    if (this != &rhs) { \n      delete[] array; \n      array = nullptr; \n      nElems = rhs.nElems; \n      if (nElems) { \n        array = new int[nElems]; \n        std::memcpy(array, rhs.array, nElems * sizeof(*array)); \n      } \n    } \n    return *this; \n  } \n \n  // ... \n}; \nExceptions and Error Handling (ERR) - ERR56-CPP.

The function allocates new storage for the copy before changing the state of the object. \nOnly after the allocation succeeds does the function proceed to change the state of the object. In \naddition, by copying the array to the newly allocated storage before deallocating the existing \narray, the function avoids the test for self-assignment, which improves the performance of the \ncode in the common case [Sutter 2004]. \n#include <cstring> \n \nclass IntArray { \n  int *array; \n  std::size_t nElems; \npublic: \n  // ... \n \n  ~IntArray() { \n    delete[] array; \n  } \n \n  IntArray(const IntArray& that); // nontrivial copy constructor \n \n  IntArray& operator=(const IntArray &rhs) { \n    int *tmp = nullptr; \n    if (rhs.nElems) { \n      tmp = new int[rhs.nElems]; \n      std::memcpy(tmp, rhs.array, rhs.nElems * sizeof(*array)); \n    } \n    delete[] array; \n    array = tmp; \n    nElems = rhs.nElems; \n    return *this; \n  } \n \n  // ... \n}; \n9.7.3 \nRisk Assessment \nCode that is not exception safe typically leads to resource leaks, causes the program to be left in \nan inconsistent or unexpected state, and ultimately results in undefined behavior at some point \nafter the first exception is thrown. \nRule \nSeverity \nLikelihood \nRemediation Cost \nPriority \nLevel \nERR56-CPP \nHigh \nLikely \nHigh \nP9 \nL2 \nExceptions and Error Handling (ERR) - ERR56-CPP.

Do not depend on the order of evaluation for side \neffects \nIn C++, modifying an object, calling a library I/O function, accessing a volatile-qualified \nvalue, or calling a function that performs one of these actions are ways to modify the state of the \nexecution environment. These actions are called side effects. All relationships between value \ncomputations and side effects can be described in terms of sequencing of their evaluations. The \nC++ Standard, [intro.execution], paragraph 13 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], establishes three \nsequencing terms: \nSequenced before is an asymmetric, transitive, pair-wise relation between evaluations \nexecuted by a single thread, which induces a partial order among those evaluations. \nGiven any two evaluations A and B, if A is sequenced before B, then the execution of A \nshall precede the execution of B. If A is not sequenced before B and B is not sequenced \nbefore A, then A and B are unsequenced. [Note: The execution of unsequenced \nevaluations can overlap. — end note] Evaluations A and B are indeterminately \nsequenced when either A is sequenced before B or B is sequenced before A, but it is \nunspecified which. [Note: Indeterminately sequenced evaluations cannot overlap, but \neither could be executed first. — end note] \nParagraph 15 further states (nonnormative text removed for brevity) the following: \nExcept where noted, evaluations of operands of individual operators and of \nsubexpressions of individual expressions are unsequenced. ... The value computations \nof the operands of an operator are sequenced before the value computation of the result \nof the operator. If a side effect on a scalar object is unsequenced relative to either \nanother side effect on the same scalar object or a value computation using the value of \nthe same scalar object, and they are not potentially concurrent, the behavior is \nundefined. ... When calling a function (whether or not the function is inline), every value \ncomputation and side effect associated with any argument expression, or with the postfix \nexpression designating the called function, is sequenced before execution of every \nexpression or statement in the body of the called function. ... Every evaluation in the \ncalling function (including other function calls) that is not otherwise specifically \nsequenced before or after the execution of the body of the called function is \nindeterminately sequenced with respect to the execution of the called function. Several \ncontexts in C++ cause evaluation of a function call, even though no corresponding \nfunction call syntax appears in the translation unit. ... The sequencing constraints on the \nexecution of the called function (as described above) are features of the function calls as \nevaluated, whatever the syntax of the expression that calls the function might be. \nExpressions (EXP) - EXP50-CPP.

([expr.log.or], paragraph 2) \n• \nIn conditional ?: expressions, every value computation and side effect associated with the \nfirst expression is sequenced before every value computation and side effect associated with \nthe second or third expression (whichever is evaluated). ([expr.cond], paragraph 1) \n• \nIn assignment expressions (including compound assignments), the assignment is sequenced \nafter the value computations of left and right operands and before the value computation of \nthe assignment expression. ([expr.ass], paragraph 1) \n• \nIn comma , expressions, every value computation and side effect associated with the left \nexpression is sequenced before every value computation and side effect associated with the \nright expression. ([expr.comma], paragraph 1) \n• \nWhen evaluating initializer lists, the value computation and side effect associated with each \ninitializer-clause is sequenced before every value computation and side effect associated with \na subsequent initializer-clause. ([dcl.init.list], paragraph 4) \n• \nWhen a signal handler is executed as a result of a call to std::raise(), the execution of \nthe handler is sequenced after the invocation of std::raise() and before its return. \n([intro.execution], paragraph 6) \n• \nThe completions of the destructors for all initialized objects with thread storage duration \nwithin a thread are sequenced before the initiation of the destructors of any object with static \nstorage duration.

([expr.new], paragraph 18) \n• \nWhen a default constructor is called to initialize an element of an array and the constructor \nhas at least one default argument, the destruction of every temporary created in a default \nargument is sequenced before the construction of the next array element, if any. \n([class.temporary], paragraph 4) \n• \nThe destruction of a temporary whose lifetime is not extended by being bound to a reference \nis sequenced before the destruction of every temporary that is constructed earlier in the same \nfull-expression.

Do not read uninitialized memory \nLocal, automatic variables assume unexpected values if they are read before they are initialized. \nThe C++ Standard, [dcl.init], paragraph 12 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the following:  \nIf no initializer is specified for an object, the object is default-initialized. When storage for \nan object with automatic or dynamic storage duration is obtained, the object has an \nindeterminate value, and if no initialization is performed for the object, that object retains \nan indeterminate value until that value is replaced. If an indeterminate value is produced \nby an evaluation, the behavior is undefined except in the following cases: \n• \nIf an indeterminate value of unsigned narrow character type is produced by the \nevaluation of: \n    — the second or third operand of a conditional expression, \n    — the right operand of a comma expression, \n    — the operand of a cast or conversion to an unsigned narrow character type, or \n    — a discarded-value expression, \nthen the result of the operation is an indeterminate value. \n• \nIf an indeterminate value of unsigned narrow character type is produced by the \nevaluation of the right operand of a simple assignment operator whose first operand \nis an lvalue of unsigned narrow character type, an indeterminate value replaces the \nvalue of the object referred to by the left operand. \n• \nIf an indeterminate value of unsigned narrow character type is produced by the \nevaluation of the initialization expression when initializing an object of unsigned \nnarrow character type, that object is initialized to an indeterminate value. \nThe default initialization of an object is described by paragraph 7 of the same subclause: \nTo default-initialize an object of type T means: \n• \nif T is a (possibly cv-qualified) class type, the default constructor for T is called (and \nthe initialization is ill-formed if T has no default constructor or overload resolution \nresults in an ambiguity or in a function that is deleted or inaccessible from the \ncontext of the initialization); \n• \nif T is an array type, each element is default-initialized; \n• \notherwise, no initialization is performed. \nIf a program calls for the default initialization of an object of a const-qualified type T, T \nshall be a class type with a user-provided default constructor. \nExpressions (EXP) - EXP53-CPP. Do not read uninitialized memory \nSEI CERT C++ CODING STANDARD (2016 EDITION) | V01 \n \n97 \nSoftware Engineering Institute | Carnegie Mellon University  \n \n[DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A] Approved for public release and unlimited distribution. \nAs a result, objects of type T with automatic or dynamic storage duration must be explicitly \ninitialized before having their value read as part of an expression unless T is a class type or an \narray thereof or is an unsigned narrow character type. If T is an unsigned narrow character type, it \nmay be used to initialize an object of unsigned narrow character type, which results in both \nobjects having an indeterminate value. This technique can be used to implement copy operations \nsuch as std::memcpy() without triggering undefined behavior. \nAdditionally, memory dynamically allocated with a new expression is default-initialized when the \nnew-initialized is omitted. Memory allocated by the standard library function std::calloc() \nis zero-initialized. Memory allocated by the standard library function std::realloc() \nassumes the values of the original pointer but may not initialize the full range of memory. \nMemory allocated by any other means (std::malloc(), allocator objects, operator \nnew(), and so on) is assumed to be default-initialized. \nObjects of static or thread storage duration are zero-initialized before any other initialization takes \nplace [ISO/IEC 14882-2014] and need not be explicitly initialized before having their value read. \nReading uninitialized variables for creating entropy is problematic because these memory \naccesses can be removed by compiler optimization. VU#925211 is an example of a vulnerability \ncaused by this coding error [VU#925211]. \n3.4.1 \nNoncompliant Code Example \nIn this noncompliant code example, an uninitialized local variable is evaluated as part of an \nexpression to print its value, resulting in undefined behavior. \n#include <iostream> \n \nvoid f() { \n  int i; \n  std::cout << i; \n} \n3.4.2 \nCompliant Solution \nIn this compliant solution, the object is initialized prior to printing its value. \n#include <iostream> \n \nvoid f() { \n  int i = 0; \n  std::cout << i; \n} \nExpressions (EXP) - EXP53-CPP.

Do not cast or delete pointers to incomplete classes \nReferring to objects of incomplete class type, also known as forward declarations, is a common \npractice. One such common usage is with the “pimpl idiom” [Sutter 2000] whereby an opaque \npointer is used to hide implementation details from a public-facing API. However, attempting to \ndelete a pointer to an object of incomplete class type can lead to undefined behavior. The C++ \nStandard, [expr.delete], paragraph 5 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the following: \nIf the object being deleted has incomplete class type at the point of deletion and the \ncomplete class has a non-trivial destructor or a deallocation function, the behavior is \nundefined. \nDo not attempt to delete a pointer to an object of incomplete type. Although it is well-formed if \nthe class has no nontrivial destructor and no associated deallocation function, it would become \nundefined behavior were a nontrivial destructor or deallocation function added later. It would be \npossible to check for a nontrivial destructor at compile time using a static_assert and the \nstd::is_trivially_destructible type trait, but no such type trait exists to test for the \npresence of a deallocation function. \nPointer downcasting to a pointer of incomplete class type has similar caveats. Pointer upcasting \n(casting from a more derived type to a less derived type) is a standard implicit conversion \noperation. C++ allows static_cast to perform the inverse operation, pointer downcasting, via \n[expr.static.cast], paragraph 7. However, when the pointed-to type is incomplete, the compiler is \nunable to make any class offset adjustments that may be required in the presence of multiple \ninheritance, resulting in a pointer that cannot be validly dereferenced. \nreinterpret_cast of a pointer type is defined by [expr.reinterpret.cast], paragraph 7, as \nbeing static_cast<cv T *>(static_cast<cv void *>(PtrValue)), meaning \nthat reinterpret_cast is simply a sequence of static_cast operations. C-style casts of \na pointer to an incomplete object type are defined as using either static_cast or \nreinterpret_cast (it is unspecified which is picked) in [expr.cast], paragraph 5. \nDo not attempt to cast through a pointer to an object of incomplete type. The cast operation itself \nis well-formed, but dereferencing the resulting pointer may result in undefined behavior if the \ndowncast is unable to adjust for multiple inheritance. \nExpressions (EXP) - EXP57-CPP.

Ensure your random number generator is properly \nseeded \nA pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) is a deterministic algorithm capable of generating \nsequences of numbers that approximate the properties of random numbers. Each sequence is \ncompletely determined by the initial state of the PRNG and the algorithm for changing the state. \nMost PRNGs make it possible to set the initial state, also called the seed state. Setting the initial \nstate is called seeding the PRNG. \nCalling a PRNG in the same initial state, either without seeding it explicitly or by seeding it with a \nconstant value, results in generating the same sequence of random numbers in different runs of the \nprogram. Consider a PRNG function that is seeded with some initial seed value and is \nconsecutively called to produce a sequence of random numbers. If the PRNG is subsequently \nseeded with the same initial seed value, then it will generate the same sequence. \nConsequently, after the first run of an improperly seeded PRNG, an attacker can predict the \nsequence of random numbers that will be generated in the future runs. Improperly seeding or \nfailing to seed the PRNG can lead to vulnerabilities, especially in security protocols. \nThe solution is to ensure that a PRNG is always properly seeded with an initial seed value that \nwill not be predictable or controllable by an attacker. A properly seeded PRNG will generate a \ndifferent sequence of random numbers each time it is run. \nNot all random number generators can be seeded. True random number generators that rely on \nhardware to produce completely unpredictable results do not need to be and cannot be seeded. \nSome high-quality PRNGs, such as the /dev/random device on some UNIX systems, also \ncannot be seeded.

Obey the one-definition rule \nNontrivial C++ programs are generally divided into multiple translation units that are later linked \ntogether to form an executable. To support such a model, C++ restricts named object definitions \nto ensure that linking will behave deterministically by requiring a single definition for an object \nacross all translation units. This model is called the one-definition rule (ODR), which is defined \nby the C++ Standard, [basic.def.odr] in paragraph 4 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014]: \nEvery program shall contain exactly one definition of every non-inline function or variable \nthat is odr-used in that program; no diagnostic required. The definition can appear \nexplicitly in the program, it can be found in the standard or a user-defined library, or \n(when appropriate) it is implicitly defined. An inline function shall be defined in every \ntranslation unit in which it is odr-used. \nThe most common approach to multitranslation unit compilation involves declarations residing in \na header file that is subsequently made available to a source file via #include. These \ndeclarations are often also definitions, such as class and function template definitions. This \napproach is allowed by an exception defined in paragraph 6, which, in part, states the following: \nThere can be more than one definition of a class type, enumeration type, inline function \nwith external linkage, class template, non-static function template, static data member of \na class template, member function of a class template, or template specialization for \nwhich some template parameters are not specified in a program provided that each \ndefinition appears in a different translation unit, and provided the definitions satisfy the \nfollowing requirements. Given such an entity named D defined in more than one \ntranslation unit.... \nIf the definitions of D satisfy all these requirements, then the program shall behave as if \nthere were a single definition of D. If the definitions of D do not satisfy these \nrequirements, then the behavior is undefined. \nThe requirements specified by paragraph 6 essentially state that that two definitions must be \nidentical (not simply equivalent). Consequently, a definition introduced in two separate translation \nunits by an #include directive generally will not violate the ODR because the definitions are \nidentical in both translation units. \nHowever, it is possible to violate the ODR of a definition introduced via #include using block \nlanguage linkage specifications, vendor-specific language extensions, and so on. A more likely \nscenario for ODR violations is that accidental definitions of differing objects will exist in different \ntranslation units. \nDo not violate the one-definition rule; violations result in undefined behavior. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP. Obey the one-definition rule \nSEI CERT C++ CODING STANDARD (2016 EDITION) | V01 \n \n77 \nSoftware Engineering Institute | Carnegie Mellon University  \n \n[DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A] Approved for public release and unlimited distribution. \n2.11.1 Noncompliant Code Example \nIn this noncompliant code example, two different translation units define a class of the same name \nwith differing definitions. Although the two definitions are functionally equivalent (they both \ndefine a class named S with a single, public, nonstatic data member int a), they are not defined \nusing the same sequence of tokens.

If the programmer intends for the same \nclass definition to be visible in both translation units because of common usage, the solution is to \nuse a header file to introduce the object into both translation units, as shown in this compliant \nsolution. \n// S.h \nstruct S { \n  int a; \n}; \n \n// a.cpp \n#include "S.h" \n  \n// b.cpp \n#include "S.h" \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

However, one of the translation units uses an implementation-defined #pragma that \nis supported by Microsoft Visual Studio to specify structure field alignment requirements. \nConsequently, the two class definitions may have differing layouts in each translation unit, which \nis a violation of the ODR. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

Consequently, when init_s() initializes the data members of s, it may result in a \nbuffer overrun. \nFor more information on the behavior of #pragma pack, see the vendor documentation for \nyour implementation, such as Microsoft Visual Studio or GCC. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

Because f() is declared as an inline function, the \ndefinition of f() must be identical in all translation units. However, each translation unit has a \nunique instance of n, resulting in a violation of the ODR. \nconst int n = 42; \n \nint g(const int &lhs, const int &rhs); \n  \ninline int f(int k) { \n  return g(k, n); \n} \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

This solution is compliant but it is not ideal. It may not be possible (or \ndesirable) to modify the signature of g(), such as if g() represented std::max() from \n<algorithm>. Also, because of the differing linkage used by n and f(), accidental violations \nof the ODR are still likely if the definition of f() is modified to odr-use n. \nconst int n = 42; \n \nint g(int lhs, int rhs); \n  \ninline int f(int k) { \n  return g(k, n); \n} \n2.11.8 Compliant Solution \nIn this compliant solution, the constant object n is replaced with an enumerator of the same name. \nNamed enumerations defined at namespace scope have the same linkage as the namespace they \nare contained in. The global namespace has external linkage, so the definition of the named \nenumeration and its contained enumerators also have external linkage. Although less aesthetically \npleasing, this compliant solution does not suffer from the same maintenance burdens of the \nprevious code because n and f() have the same linkage. \nenum Constants { \n  N = 42 \n}; \n \nint g(const int &lhs, const int &rhs); \n  \ninline int f(int k) { \n  return g(k, N); \n} \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

As shown in “Support for Whole-Program Analysis and the Verification of the \nOne-Definition Rule in C++” [Quinlan 2006], failing to enforce the ODR enables a virtual \nfunction pointer attack known as the VPTR exploit. In this exploit, an object’s virtual function \ntable is corrupted so that calling a virtual function on the object results in malicious code being \nexecuted. See the paper by Quinlan and colleagues for more details.

Do not read uninitialized memory \nLocal, automatic variables assume unexpected values if they are read before they are initialized. \nThe C++ Standard, [dcl.init], paragraph 12 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the following:  \nIf no initializer is specified for an object, the object is default-initialized. When storage for \nan object with automatic or dynamic storage duration is obtained, the object has an \nindeterminate value, and if no initialization is performed for the object, that object retains \nan indeterminate value until that value is replaced. If an indeterminate value is produced \nby an evaluation, the behavior is undefined except in the following cases: \n• \nIf an indeterminate value of unsigned narrow character type is produced by the \nevaluation of: \n    — the second or third operand of a conditional expression, \n    — the right operand of a comma expression, \n    — the operand of a cast or conversion to an unsigned narrow character type, or \n    — a discarded-value expression, \nthen the result of the operation is an indeterminate value. \n• \nIf an indeterminate value of unsigned narrow character type is produced by the \nevaluation of the right operand of a simple assignment operator whose first operand \nis an lvalue of unsigned narrow character type, an indeterminate value replaces the \nvalue of the object referred to by the left operand. \n• \nIf an indeterminate value of unsigned narrow character type is produced by the \nevaluation of the initialization expression when initializing an object of unsigned \nnarrow character type, that object is initialized to an indeterminate value. \nThe default initialization of an object is described by paragraph 7 of the same subclause: \nTo default-initialize an object of type T means: \n• \nif T is a (possibly cv-qualified) class type, the default constructor for T is called (and \nthe initialization is ill-formed if T has no default constructor or overload resolution \nresults in an ambiguity or in a function that is deleted or inaccessible from the \ncontext of the initialization); \n• \nif T is an array type, each element is default-initialized; \n• \notherwise, no initialization is performed. \nIf a program calls for the default initialization of an object of a const-qualified type T, T \nshall be a class type with a user-provided default constructor. \nExpressions (EXP) - EXP53-CPP. Do not read uninitialized memory \nSEI CERT C++ CODING STANDARD (2016 EDITION) | V01 \n \n97 \nSoftware Engineering Institute | Carnegie Mellon University  \n \n[DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A] Approved for public release and unlimited distribution. \nAs a result, objects of type T with automatic or dynamic storage duration must be explicitly \ninitialized before having their value read as part of an expression unless T is a class type or an \narray thereof or is an unsigned narrow character type. If T is an unsigned narrow character type, it \nmay be used to initialize an object of unsigned narrow character type, which results in both \nobjects having an indeterminate value. This technique can be used to implement copy operations \nsuch as std::memcpy() without triggering undefined behavior. \nAdditionally, memory dynamically allocated with a new expression is default-initialized when the \nnew-initialized is omitted. Memory allocated by the standard library function std::calloc() \nis zero-initialized. Memory allocated by the standard library function std::realloc() \nassumes the values of the original pointer but may not initialize the full range of memory. \nMemory allocated by any other means (std::malloc(), allocator objects, operator \nnew(), and so on) is assumed to be default-initialized. \nObjects of static or thread storage duration are zero-initialized before any other initialization takes \nplace [ISO/IEC 14882-2014] and need not be explicitly initialized before having their value read. \nReading uninitialized variables for creating entropy is problematic because these memory \naccesses can be removed by compiler optimization.

Do not alternately input and output from a file stream \nwithout an intervening positioning call \nThe C++ Standard, [filebuf], paragraph 2 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the following: \nThe restrictions on reading and writing a sequence controlled by an object of class \nbasic_filebuf<charT, traits> are the same as for reading and writing with the \nStandard C library FILEs. \nThe C Standard, subclause 7.19.5.3, paragraph 6 [ISO/IEC 9899:1999], places the following \nrestrictions on FILE objects opened for both reading and writing: \nWhen a file is opened with update mode . . ., both input and output may be performed on \nthe associated stream. However, output shall not be directly followed by input without an \nintervening call to the fflush function or to a file positioning function (fseek, \nfsetpos, or rewind), and input shall not be directly followed by output without an \nintervening call to a file positioning function, unless the input operation encounters end-\nof-file. \nConsequently, the following scenarios can result in undefined behavior: \n• \nReceiving input from a stream directly following an output to that stream without an \nintervening call to std::basic_filebuf<T>::seekoff() if the file is not at end-of-\nfile \n• \nOutputting to a stream after receiving input from that stream without a call to \nstd::basic_filebuf<T>::seekoff() if the file is not at end-of-file \nNo other std::basic_filebuf<T> function guarantees behavior as if a call were made to a \nstandard C library file-positioning function, or std::fflush(). \nCalling std::basic_ostream<T>::seekp() or \nstd::basic_istream<T>::seekg() eventually results in a call to \nstd::basic_filebuf<T>::seekoff() for file stream positioning.

Preserve thread safety and liveness when using \ncondition variables \nBoth thread safety and liveness are concerns when using condition variables. The thread-safety \nproperty requires that all objects maintain consistent states in a multithreaded environment [Lea \n2000]. The liveness property requires that every operation or function invocation execute to \ncompletion without interruption; for example, there is no deadlock. \nCondition variables must be used inside a while loop. (See CON54-CPP. Wrap functions that \ncan spuriously wake up in a loop for more information.) To guarantee liveness, programs must \ntest the while loop condition before invoking the condition_variable::wait() \nmember function. This early test checks whether another thread has already satisfied the condition \npredicate and has sent a notification. Invoking wait() after the notification has been sent results \nin indefinite blocking. \nTo guarantee thread safety, programs must test the while loop condition after returning from \nwait(). When a given thread invokes wait(), it will attempt to block until its condition \nvariable is signaled by a call to condition_variable::notify_all() or to \ncondition_variable::notify_one(). \nThe notify_one() member function unblocks one of the threads that are blocked on the \nspecified condition variable at the time of the call. If multiple threads are waiting on the same \ncondition variable, the scheduler can select any of those threads to be awakened (assuming that all \nthreads have the same priority level).  \nThe notify_all() member function unblocks all of the threads that are blocked on the \nspecified condition variable at the time of the call. The order in which threads execute following a \ncall to notify_all() is unspecified. Consequently, an unrelated thread could start executing, \ndiscover that its condition predicate is satisfied, and resume execution even though it was \nsupposed to remain dormant.  \nFor these reasons, threads must check the condition predicate after the wait() function returns. \nA while loop is the best choice for checking the condition predicate both before and after \ninvoking wait(). \nThe use of notify_one() is safe if each thread uses a unique condition variable. If multiple \nthreads share a condition variable, the use of notify_one() is safe only if the following \nconditions are met: \n• \nAll threads must perform the same set of operations after waking up, which means that any \nthread can be selected to wake up and resume for a single invocation of notify_one(). \n• \nOnly one thread is required to wake upon receiving the signal. \nThe notify_all() function can be used to unblock all of the threads that are blocked on the \nspecified condition variable if the use of notify_one() is unsafe. \nConcurrency (CON) - CON55-CPP.

Guarantee exception safety \nProper handling of errors and exceptional situations is essential for the continued correct \noperation of software. The preferred mechanism for reporting errors in a C++ program is \nexceptions rather than error codes. A number of core language facilities, including \ndynamic_cast, operator new(), and typeid, report failures by throwing exceptions. In \naddition, the C++ standard library makes heavy use of exceptions to report several different kinds \nof failures. Few C++ programs manage to avoid using some of these facilities. Consequently, the \nvast majority of C++ programs must be prepared for exceptions to occur and must handle each \nappropriately. (See ERR51-CPP. Handle all exceptions.) \nBecause exceptions introduce code paths into a program, it is important to consider the effects of \ncode taking such paths and to avoid any undesirable effects that might arise otherwise. Some such \neffects include failure to release an acquired resource, thereby introducing a leak, and failure to \nreestablish a class invariant after a partial update to an object or even a partial object update while \nmaintaining all invariants. Code that avoids any such undesirable effects is said to be exception \nsafe. \nBased on the preceding effects, the following table distinguishes three kinds of exception safety \nguarantees from most to least desired. \nGuarantee \nDescription \nExample \nStrong \n \nThe strong exception safety guarantee is a property of an operation \nsuch that, in addition to satisfying the basic exception safety \nguarantee, if the operation terminates by raising an exception, it has \nno observable effects on program state. \nStrong Exception Safety \n \nBasic \n \nThe basic exception safety guarantee is a property of an operation \nsuch that, if the operation terminates by raising an exception, it \npreserves program state invariants and prevents resource leaks. \nBasic Exception Safety \n \nNone \n \nCode that provides neither the strong nor basic exception safety \nguarantee is not exception safe. \nNo Exception Safety \n \nCode that guarantees strong exception safety also guarantees basic exception safety. \nBecause all exceptions thrown in an application must be handled, in compliance with ERR50-\nCPP. Do not abruptly terminate the program, it is critical that thrown exceptions do not leave the \nprogram in an indeterminate state where invariants are violated. That is, the program must provide \nbasic exception safety for all invariants and may choose to provide strong exception safety for \nsome invariants. Whether exception handling is used to control the termination of the program or \nto recover from an exceptional situation, a violated invariant leaves the program in a state where \ngraceful continued execution is likely to introduce security vulnerabilities. Thus, code that \nprovides no exception safety guarantee is unsafe and must be considered defective. \nExceptions and Error Handling (ERR) - ERR56-CPP.

The \nimplicit invariants of the class are that the array member is a valid (possibly null) pointer and \nthat the nElems member stores the number of elements in the array pointed to by array. The \nfunction deallocates array and assigns the element counter, nElems, before allocating a new \nblock of memory for the copy. As a result, if the new expression throws an exception, the \nfunction will have modified the state of both member variables in a way that violates the implicit \ninvariants of the class. Consequently, such an object is in an indeterminate state and any operation \non it, including its destruction, results in undefined behavior. \n#include <cstring> \n \nclass IntArray { \n  int *array; \n  std::size_t nElems; \npublic: \n  // ... \n \n  ~IntArray() { \n    delete[] array; \n  } \n \n  IntArray(const IntArray& that); // nontrivial copy constructor \n  IntArray& operator=(const IntArray &rhs) { \n    if (this != &rhs) { \n      delete[] array; \n      array = nullptr; \n      nElems = rhs.nElems; \n      if (nElems) { \n        array = new int[nElems]; \n        std::memcpy(array, rhs.array, nElems * sizeof(*array)); \n      } \n    } \n    return *this; \n  } \n \n  // ... \n}; \nExceptions and Error Handling (ERR) - ERR56-CPP.

The function allocates new storage for the copy before changing the state of the object. \nOnly after the allocation succeeds does the function proceed to change the state of the object. In \naddition, by copying the array to the newly allocated storage before deallocating the existing \narray, the function avoids the test for self-assignment, which improves the performance of the \ncode in the common case [Sutter 2004]. \n#include <cstring> \n \nclass IntArray { \n  int *array; \n  std::size_t nElems; \npublic: \n  // ... \n \n  ~IntArray() { \n    delete[] array; \n  } \n \n  IntArray(const IntArray& that); // nontrivial copy constructor \n \n  IntArray& operator=(const IntArray &rhs) { \n    int *tmp = nullptr; \n    if (rhs.nElems) { \n      tmp = new int[rhs.nElems]; \n      std::memcpy(tmp, rhs.array, rhs.nElems * sizeof(*array)); \n    } \n    delete[] array; \n    array = tmp; \n    nElems = rhs.nElems; \n    return *this; \n  } \n \n  // ... \n}; \n9.7.3 \nRisk Assessment \nCode that is not exception safe typically leads to resource leaks, causes the program to be left in \nan inconsistent or unexpected state, and ultimately results in undefined behavior at some point \nafter the first exception is thrown. \nRule \nSeverity \nLikelihood \nRemediation Cost \nPriority \nLevel \nERR56-CPP \nHigh \nLikely \nHigh \nP9 \nL2 \nExceptions and Error Handling (ERR) - ERR56-CPP.

Do not cast to an out-of-range enumeration value \nEnumerations in C++ come in two forms: scoped enumerations in which the underlying type is \nfixed and unscoped enumerations in which the underlying type may or may not be fixed. The \nrange of values that can be represented by either form of enumeration may include enumerator \nvalues not specified by the enumeration itself. The range of valid enumeration values for an \nenumeration type is defined by the C++ Standard, [dcl.enum], in paragraph 8 [ISO/IEC 14882-\n2014]: \nFor an enumeration whose underlying type is fixed, the values of the enumeration are \nthe values of the underlying type. Otherwise, for an enumeration where emin is the \nsmallest enumerator and emax is the largest, the values of the enumeration are the \nvalues in the range bmin to bmax, defined as follows: Let K be 1 for a two’s complement \nrepresentation and 0 for a one’s complement or sign-magnitude representation. bmax is \nthe smallest value greater than or equal to max(|emin| − K, |emax|) and equal to 2M − 1, \nwhere M is a non-negative integer. bmin is zero if emin is non-negative and −(bmax + K) \notherwise. The size of the smallest bit-field large enough to hold all the values of the \nenumeration type is max(M, 1) if bmin is zero and M + 1 otherwise. It is possible to define \nan enumeration that has values not defined by any of its enumerators. If the enumerator-\nlist is empty, the values of the enumeration are as if the enumeration had a single \nenumerator with value 0. \nThe C++ Standard, [expr.static.cast], paragraph 10, states the following: \nA value of integral or enumeration type can be explicitly converted to an enumeration \ntype. The value is unchanged if the original value is within the range of the enumeration \nvalues (7.2). Otherwise, the resulting value is unspecified (and might not be in that \nrange). A value of floating-point type can also be explicitly converted to an enumeration \ntype. The resulting value is the same as converting the original value to the underlying \ntype of the enumeration (4.9), and subsequently to the enumeration type. \nTo avoid operating on unspecified values, the arithmetic value being cast must be within the range \nof values the enumeration can represent.

On a two’s complement system, the \nvalid range of values that can be represented by EnumType are [0..3], so if a value outside of that \nrange were passed to f(), the cast to EnumType would result in an unspecified value, and using \nthat value within the if statement results in unspecified behavior. \nenum EnumType { \n  First, \n  Second, \n  Third \n}; \n \nvoid f(int intVar) { \n  EnumType enumVar = static_cast<EnumType>(intVar); \n \n  if (enumVar < First || enumVar > Third) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \n4.1.2 \nCompliant Solution (Bounds Checking) \nThis compliant solution checks that the value can be represented by the enumeration type before \nperforming the conversion to guarantee the conversion does not result in an unspecified value.

Obey the one-definition rule \nNontrivial C++ programs are generally divided into multiple translation units that are later linked \ntogether to form an executable. To support such a model, C++ restricts named object definitions \nto ensure that linking will behave deterministically by requiring a single definition for an object \nacross all translation units. This model is called the one-definition rule (ODR), which is defined \nby the C++ Standard, [basic.def.odr] in paragraph 4 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014]: \nEvery program shall contain exactly one definition of every non-inline function or variable \nthat is odr-used in that program; no diagnostic required. The definition can appear \nexplicitly in the program, it can be found in the standard or a user-defined library, or \n(when appropriate) it is implicitly defined. An inline function shall be defined in every \ntranslation unit in which it is odr-used. \nThe most common approach to multitranslation unit compilation involves declarations residing in \na header file that is subsequently made available to a source file via #include. These \ndeclarations are often also definitions, such as class and function template definitions. This \napproach is allowed by an exception defined in paragraph 6, which, in part, states the following: \nThere can be more than one definition of a class type, enumeration type, inline function \nwith external linkage, class template, non-static function template, static data member of \na class template, member function of a class template, or template specialization for \nwhich some template parameters are not specified in a program provided that each \ndefinition appears in a different translation unit, and provided the definitions satisfy the \nfollowing requirements. Given such an entity named D defined in more than one \ntranslation unit.... \nIf the definitions of D satisfy all these requirements, then the program shall behave as if \nthere were a single definition of D. If the definitions of D do not satisfy these \nrequirements, then the behavior is undefined. \nThe requirements specified by paragraph 6 essentially state that that two definitions must be \nidentical (not simply equivalent). Consequently, a definition introduced in two separate translation \nunits by an #include directive generally will not violate the ODR because the definitions are \nidentical in both translation units. \nHowever, it is possible to violate the ODR of a definition introduced via #include using block \nlanguage linkage specifications, vendor-specific language extensions, and so on. A more likely \nscenario for ODR violations is that accidental definitions of differing objects will exist in different \ntranslation units. \nDo not violate the one-definition rule; violations result in undefined behavior. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP. Obey the one-definition rule \nSEI CERT C++ CODING STANDARD (2016 EDITION) | V01 \n \n77 \nSoftware Engineering Institute | Carnegie Mellon University  \n \n[DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A] Approved for public release and unlimited distribution. \n2.11.1 Noncompliant Code Example \nIn this noncompliant code example, two different translation units define a class of the same name \nwith differing definitions. Although the two definitions are functionally equivalent (they both \ndefine a class named S with a single, public, nonstatic data member int a), they are not defined \nusing the same sequence of tokens. This code example violates the ODR and results in undefined \nbehavior. \n// a.cpp \nstruct S { \n  int a; \n}; \n \n// b.cpp \nclass S { \npublic: \n  int a; \n}; \n2.11.2 Compliant Solution \nThe correct mitigation depends on programmer intent. If the programmer intends for the same \nclass definition to be visible in both translation units because of common usage, the solution is to \nuse a header file to introduce the object into both translation units, as shown in this compliant \nsolution. \n// S.h \nstruct S { \n  int a; \n}; \n \n// a.cpp \n#include "S.h" \n  \n// b.cpp \n#include "S.h" \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

However, one of the translation units uses an implementation-defined #pragma that \nis supported by Microsoft Visual Studio to specify structure field alignment requirements. \nConsequently, the two class definitions may have differing layouts in each translation unit, which \nis a violation of the ODR. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

Consequently, when init_s() initializes the data members of s, it may result in a \nbuffer overrun. \nFor more information on the behavior of #pragma pack, see the vendor documentation for \nyour implementation, such as Microsoft Visual Studio or GCC. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

Because f() is declared as an inline function, the \ndefinition of f() must be identical in all translation units. However, each translation unit has a \nunique instance of n, resulting in a violation of the ODR. \nconst int n = 42; \n \nint g(const int &lhs, const int &rhs); \n  \ninline int f(int k) { \n  return g(k, n); \n} \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

This solution is compliant but it is not ideal. It may not be possible (or \ndesirable) to modify the signature of g(), such as if g() represented std::max() from \n<algorithm>. Also, because of the differing linkage used by n and f(), accidental violations \nof the ODR are still likely if the definition of f() is modified to odr-use n. \nconst int n = 42; \n \nint g(int lhs, int rhs); \n  \ninline int f(int k) { \n  return g(k, n); \n} \n2.11.8 Compliant Solution \nIn this compliant solution, the constant object n is replaced with an enumerator of the same name. \nNamed enumerations defined at namespace scope have the same linkage as the namespace they \nare contained in. The global namespace has external linkage, so the definition of the named \nenumeration and its contained enumerators also have external linkage. Although less aesthetically \npleasing, this compliant solution does not suffer from the same maintenance burdens of the \nprevious code because n and f() have the same linkage. \nenum Constants { \n  N = 42 \n}; \n \nint g(const int &lhs, const int &rhs); \n  \ninline int f(int k) { \n  return g(k, N); \n} \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

As shown in “Support for Whole-Program Analysis and the Verification of the \nOne-Definition Rule in C++” [Quinlan 2006], failing to enforce the ODR enables a virtual \nfunction pointer attack known as the VPTR exploit. In this exploit, an object’s virtual function \ntable is corrupted so that calling a virtual function on the object results in malicious code being \nexecuted. See the paper by Quinlan and colleagues for more details. However, note that to \nintroduce the malicious class, the attacker must have access to the system building the code. \nRule \nSeverity \nLikelihood \nRemediation Cost \nPriority \nLevel \nDCL60-CPP \nHigh \nUnlikely \nHigh \nP3 \nL3 \n2.11.10 \nBibliography \n[ISO/IEC 14882-2014] \nSubclause 3.2, “One Definition Rule” \n[Quinlan 2006] \n \nExpressions (EXP) - EXP50-CPP.

Do not read uninitialized memory \nLocal, automatic variables assume unexpected values if they are read before they are initialized. \nThe C++ Standard, [dcl.init], paragraph 12 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the following:  \nIf no initializer is specified for an object, the object is default-initialized. When storage for \nan object with automatic or dynamic storage duration is obtained, the object has an \nindeterminate value, and if no initialization is performed for the object, that object retains \nan indeterminate value until that value is replaced. If an indeterminate value is produced \nby an evaluation, the behavior is undefined except in the following cases: \n• \nIf an indeterminate value of unsigned narrow character type is produced by the \nevaluation of: \n    — the second or third operand of a conditional expression, \n    — the right operand of a comma expression, \n    — the operand of a cast or conversion to an unsigned narrow character type, or \n    — a discarded-value expression, \nthen the result of the operation is an indeterminate value. \n• \nIf an indeterminate value of unsigned narrow character type is produced by the \nevaluation of the right operand of a simple assignment operator whose first operand \nis an lvalue of unsigned narrow character type, an indeterminate value replaces the \nvalue of the object referred to by the left operand. \n• \nIf an indeterminate value of unsigned narrow character type is produced by the \nevaluation of the initialization expression when initializing an object of unsigned \nnarrow character type, that object is initialized to an indeterminate value. \nThe default initialization of an object is described by paragraph 7 of the same subclause: \nTo default-initialize an object of type T means: \n• \nif T is a (possibly cv-qualified) class type, the default constructor for T is called (and \nthe initialization is ill-formed if T has no default constructor or overload resolution \nresults in an ambiguity or in a function that is deleted or inaccessible from the \ncontext of the initialization); \n• \nif T is an array type, each element is default-initialized; \n• \notherwise, no initialization is performed. \nIf a program calls for the default initialization of an object of a const-qualified type T, T \nshall be a class type with a user-provided default constructor. \nExpressions (EXP) - EXP53-CPP. Do not read uninitialized memory \nSEI CERT C++ CODING STANDARD (2016 EDITION) | V01 \n \n97 \nSoftware Engineering Institute | Carnegie Mellon University  \n \n[DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A] Approved for public release and unlimited distribution. \nAs a result, objects of type T with automatic or dynamic storage duration must be explicitly \ninitialized before having their value read as part of an expression unless T is a class type or an \narray thereof or is an unsigned narrow character type. If T is an unsigned narrow character type, it \nmay be used to initialize an object of unsigned narrow character type, which results in both \nobjects having an indeterminate value. This technique can be used to implement copy operations \nsuch as std::memcpy() without triggering undefined behavior. \nAdditionally, memory dynamically allocated with a new expression is default-initialized when the \nnew-initialized is omitted. Memory allocated by the standard library function std::calloc() \nis zero-initialized. Memory allocated by the standard library function std::realloc() \nassumes the values of the original pointer but may not initialize the full range of memory. \nMemory allocated by any other means (std::malloc(), allocator objects, operator \nnew(), and so on) is assumed to be default-initialized. \nObjects of static or thread storage duration are zero-initialized before any other initialization takes \nplace [ISO/IEC 14882-2014] and need not be explicitly initialized before having their value read. \nReading uninitialized variables for creating entropy is problematic because these memory \naccesses can be removed by compiler optimization. VU#925211 is an example of a vulnerability \ncaused by this coding error [VU#925211]. \n3.4.1 \nNoncompliant Code Example \nIn this noncompliant code example, an uninitialized local variable is evaluated as part of an \nexpression to print its value, resulting in undefined behavior. \n#include <iostream> \n \nvoid f() { \n  int i; \n  std::cout << i; \n} \n3.4.2 \nCompliant Solution \nIn this compliant solution, the object is initialized prior to printing its value. \n#include <iostream> \n \nvoid f() { \n  int i = 0; \n  std::cout << i; \n} \nExpressions (EXP) - EXP53-CPP.

However, output shall not be directly followed by input without an \nintervening call to the fflush function or to a file positioning function (fseek, \nfsetpos, or rewind), and input shall not be directly followed by output without an \nintervening call to a file positioning function, unless the input operation encounters end-\nof-file. \nConsequently, the following scenarios can result in undefined behavior: \n• \nReceiving input from a stream directly following an output to that stream without an \nintervening call to std::basic_filebuf<T>::seekoff() if the file is not at end-of-\nfile \n• \nOutputting to a stream after receiving input from that stream without a call to \nstd::basic_filebuf<T>::seekoff() if the file is not at end-of-file \nNo other std::basic_filebuf<T> function guarantees behavior as if a call were made to a \nstandard C library file-positioning function, or std::fflush(). \nCalling std::basic_ostream<T>::seekp() or \nstd::basic_istream<T>::seekg() eventually results in a call to \nstd::basic_filebuf<T>::seekoff() for file stream positioning.

Preserve thread safety and liveness when using \ncondition variables \nBoth thread safety and liveness are concerns when using condition variables. The thread-safety \nproperty requires that all objects maintain consistent states in a multithreaded environment [Lea \n2000]. The liveness property requires that every operation or function invocation execute to \ncompletion without interruption; for example, there is no deadlock. \nCondition variables must be used inside a while loop. (See CON54-CPP. Wrap functions that \ncan spuriously wake up in a loop for more information.) To guarantee liveness, programs must \ntest the while loop condition before invoking the condition_variable::wait() \nmember function. This early test checks whether another thread has already satisfied the condition \npredicate and has sent a notification. Invoking wait() after the notification has been sent results \nin indefinite blocking. \nTo guarantee thread safety, programs must test the while loop condition after returning from \nwait(). When a given thread invokes wait(), it will attempt to block until its condition \nvariable is signaled by a call to condition_variable::notify_all() or to \ncondition_variable::notify_one(). \nThe notify_one() member function unblocks one of the threads that are blocked on the \nspecified condition variable at the time of the call. If multiple threads are waiting on the same \ncondition variable, the scheduler can select any of those threads to be awakened (assuming that all \nthreads have the same priority level).  \nThe notify_all() member function unblocks all of the threads that are blocked on the \nspecified condition variable at the time of the call. The order in which threads execute following a \ncall to notify_all() is unspecified. Consequently, an unrelated thread could start executing, \ndiscover that its condition predicate is satisfied, and resume execution even though it was \nsupposed to remain dormant.  \nFor these reasons, threads must check the condition predicate after the wait() function returns. \nA while loop is the best choice for checking the condition predicate both before and after \ninvoking wait(). \nThe use of notify_one() is safe if each thread uses a unique condition variable. If multiple \nthreads share a condition variable, the use of notify_one() is safe only if the following \nconditions are met: \n• \nAll threads must perform the same set of operations after waking up, which means that any \nthread can be selected to wake up and resume for a single invocation of notify_one(). \n• \nOnly one thread is required to wake upon receiving the signal. \nThe notify_all() function can be used to unblock all of the threads that are blocked on the \nspecified condition variable if the use of notify_one() is unsafe. \nConcurrency (CON) - CON55-CPP.

The \ncurrentStep variable holds the current step level and is incremented when the respective \nthread completes. Finally, another thread is signaled so that the next step can be executed. Each \nthread waits until its step level is ready, and the wait() call is wrapped inside a while loop, in \ncompliance with CON54-CPP.

Each thread has its own distinct \ncondition predicate because each thread requires currentStep to have a different value before \nproceeding. When the condition variable is signaled, any of the waiting threads can wake up. The \nfollowing table illustrates a possible scenario in which the liveness property is violated. If, by \nchance, the notified thread is not the thread with the next step value, that thread will wait again. \nNo additional notifications can occur, and eventually the pool of available threads will be \nexhausted. \nDeadlock: Out-of-Sequence Step Value \nTime \nThread # \n(my_step) \ncurrent_step \nAction \n0 \n3 \n0 \nThread 3 executes the first time: the predicate is false -> \nwait() \n1 \n2 \n0 \nThread 2 executes the first time: the predicate is false -> \nwait() \n2 \n4 \n0 \nThread 4 executes the first time: the predicate is false -> \nwait() \n3 \n0 \n0 \nThread 0 executes the first time: the predicate is true -> \ncurrentStep++; notify_one() \n4 \n1 \n1 \nThread 1 executes the first time: the predicate is true -> \ncurrentStep++; notify_one() \n5 \n3 \n2 \nThread 3 wakes up (scheduler choice): the predicate is \nfalse -> wait() \n6 \n— \n— \nThread exhaustion!

Guarantee exception safety \nProper handling of errors and exceptional situations is essential for the continued correct \noperation of software. The preferred mechanism for reporting errors in a C++ program is \nexceptions rather than error codes. A number of core language facilities, including \ndynamic_cast, operator new(), and typeid, report failures by throwing exceptions. In \naddition, the C++ standard library makes heavy use of exceptions to report several different kinds \nof failures. Few C++ programs manage to avoid using some of these facilities. Consequently, the \nvast majority of C++ programs must be prepared for exceptions to occur and must handle each \nappropriately. (See ERR51-CPP. Handle all exceptions.) \nBecause exceptions introduce code paths into a program, it is important to consider the effects of \ncode taking such paths and to avoid any undesirable effects that might arise otherwise. Some such \neffects include failure to release an acquired resource, thereby introducing a leak, and failure to \nreestablish a class invariant after a partial update to an object or even a partial object update while \nmaintaining all invariants. Code that avoids any such undesirable effects is said to be exception \nsafe. \nBased on the preceding effects, the following table distinguishes three kinds of exception safety \nguarantees from most to least desired. \nGuarantee \nDescription \nExample \nStrong \n \nThe strong exception safety guarantee is a property of an operation \nsuch that, in addition to satisfying the basic exception safety \nguarantee, if the operation terminates by raising an exception, it has \nno observable effects on program state. \nStrong Exception Safety \n \nBasic \n \nThe basic exception safety guarantee is a property of an operation \nsuch that, if the operation terminates by raising an exception, it \npreserves program state invariants and prevents resource leaks. \nBasic Exception Safety \n \nNone \n \nCode that provides neither the strong nor basic exception safety \nguarantee is not exception safe. \nNo Exception Safety \n \nCode that guarantees strong exception safety also guarantees basic exception safety. \nBecause all exceptions thrown in an application must be handled, in compliance with ERR50-\nCPP. Do not abruptly terminate the program, it is critical that thrown exceptions do not leave the \nprogram in an indeterminate state where invariants are violated. That is, the program must provide \nbasic exception safety for all invariants and may choose to provide strong exception safety for \nsome invariants. Whether exception handling is used to control the termination of the program or \nto recover from an exceptional situation, a violated invariant leaves the program in a state where \ngraceful continued execution is likely to introduce security vulnerabilities. Thus, code that \nprovides no exception safety guarantee is unsafe and must be considered defective. \nExceptions and Error Handling (ERR) - ERR56-CPP.

The \nimplicit invariants of the class are that the array member is a valid (possibly null) pointer and \nthat the nElems member stores the number of elements in the array pointed to by array. The \nfunction deallocates array and assigns the element counter, nElems, before allocating a new \nblock of memory for the copy. As a result, if the new expression throws an exception, the \nfunction will have modified the state of both member variables in a way that violates the implicit \ninvariants of the class. Consequently, such an object is in an indeterminate state and any operation \non it, including its destruction, results in undefined behavior. \n#include <cstring> \n \nclass IntArray { \n  int *array; \n  std::size_t nElems; \npublic: \n  // ... \n \n  ~IntArray() { \n    delete[] array; \n  } \n \n  IntArray(const IntArray& that); // nontrivial copy constructor \n  IntArray& operator=(const IntArray &rhs) { \n    if (this != &rhs) { \n      delete[] array; \n      array = nullptr; \n      nElems = rhs.nElems; \n      if (nElems) { \n        array = new int[nElems]; \n        std::memcpy(array, rhs.array, nElems * sizeof(*array)); \n      } \n    } \n    return *this; \n  } \n \n  // ... \n}; \nExceptions and Error Handling (ERR) - ERR56-CPP.

The function allocates new storage for the copy before changing the state of the object. \nOnly after the allocation succeeds does the function proceed to change the state of the object. In \naddition, by copying the array to the newly allocated storage before deallocating the existing \narray, the function avoids the test for self-assignment, which improves the performance of the \ncode in the common case [Sutter 2004]. \n#include <cstring> \n \nclass IntArray { \n  int *array; \n  std::size_t nElems; \npublic: \n  // ... \n \n  ~IntArray() { \n    delete[] array; \n  } \n \n  IntArray(const IntArray& that); // nontrivial copy constructor \n \n  IntArray& operator=(const IntArray &rhs) { \n    int *tmp = nullptr; \n    if (rhs.nElems) { \n      tmp = new int[rhs.nElems]; \n      std::memcpy(tmp, rhs.array, rhs.nElems * sizeof(*array)); \n    } \n    delete[] array; \n    array = tmp; \n    nElems = rhs.nElems; \n    return *this; \n  } \n \n  // ... \n}; \n9.7.3 \nRisk Assessment \nCode that is not exception safe typically leads to resource leaks, causes the program to be left in \nan inconsistent or unexpected state, and ultimately results in undefined behavior at some point \nafter the first exception is thrown. \nRule \nSeverity \nLikelihood \nRemediation Cost \nPriority \nLevel \nERR56-CPP \nHigh \nLikely \nHigh \nP9 \nL2 \nExceptions and Error Handling (ERR) - ERR56-CPP.

Do not cast to an out-of-range enumeration value \nEnumerations in C++ come in two forms: scoped enumerations in which the underlying type is \nfixed and unscoped enumerations in which the underlying type may or may not be fixed. The \nrange of values that can be represented by either form of enumeration may include enumerator \nvalues not specified by the enumeration itself. The range of valid enumeration values for an \nenumeration type is defined by the C++ Standard, [dcl.enum], in paragraph 8 [ISO/IEC 14882-\n2014]: \nFor an enumeration whose underlying type is fixed, the values of the enumeration are \nthe values of the underlying type. Otherwise, for an enumeration where emin is the \nsmallest enumerator and emax is the largest, the values of the enumeration are the \nvalues in the range bmin to bmax, defined as follows: Let K be 1 for a two’s complement \nrepresentation and 0 for a one’s complement or sign-magnitude representation. bmax is \nthe smallest value greater than or equal to max(|emin| − K, |emax|) and equal to 2M − 1, \nwhere M is a non-negative integer. bmin is zero if emin is non-negative and −(bmax + K) \notherwise. The size of the smallest bit-field large enough to hold all the values of the \nenumeration type is max(M, 1) if bmin is zero and M + 1 otherwise. It is possible to define \nan enumeration that has values not defined by any of its enumerators. If the enumerator-\nlist is empty, the values of the enumeration are as if the enumeration had a single \nenumerator with value 0. \nThe C++ Standard, [expr.static.cast], paragraph 10, states the following: \nA value of integral or enumeration type can be explicitly converted to an enumeration \ntype. The value is unchanged if the original value is within the range of the enumeration \nvalues (7.2). Otherwise, the resulting value is unspecified (and might not be in that \nrange). A value of floating-point type can also be explicitly converted to an enumeration \ntype. The resulting value is the same as converting the original value to the underlying \ntype of the enumeration (4.9), and subsequently to the enumeration type. \nTo avoid operating on unspecified values, the arithmetic value being cast must be within the range \nof values the enumeration can represent. When dynamically checking for out-of-range values, \nchecking must be performed before the cast expression. \nIntegers (INT) - INT50-CPP.

On a two’s complement system, the \nvalid range of values that can be represented by EnumType are [0..3], so if a value outside of that \nrange were passed to f(), the cast to EnumType would result in an unspecified value, and using \nthat value within the if statement results in unspecified behavior. \nenum EnumType { \n  First, \n  Second, \n  Third \n}; \n \nvoid f(int intVar) { \n  EnumType enumVar = static_cast<EnumType>(intVar); \n \n  if (enumVar < First || enumVar > Third) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \n4.1.2 \nCompliant Solution (Bounds Checking) \nThis compliant solution checks that the value can be represented by the enumeration type before \nperforming the conversion to guarantee the conversion does not result in an unspecified value.

Do not read uninitialized memory \nLocal, automatic variables assume unexpected values if they are read before they are initialized. \nThe C++ Standard, [dcl.init], paragraph 12 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the following:  \nIf no initializer is specified for an object, the object is default-initialized. When storage for \nan object with automatic or dynamic storage duration is obtained, the object has an \nindeterminate value, and if no initialization is performed for the object, that object retains \nan indeterminate value until that value is replaced. If an indeterminate value is produced \nby an evaluation, the behavior is undefined except in the following cases: \n• \nIf an indeterminate value of unsigned narrow character type is produced by the \nevaluation of: \n    — the second or third operand of a conditional expression, \n    — the right operand of a comma expression, \n    — the operand of a cast or conversion to an unsigned narrow character type, or \n    — a discarded-value expression, \nthen the result of the operation is an indeterminate value. \n• \nIf an indeterminate value of unsigned narrow character type is produced by the \nevaluation of the right operand of a simple assignment operator whose first operand \nis an lvalue of unsigned narrow character type, an indeterminate value replaces the \nvalue of the object referred to by the left operand. \n• \nIf an indeterminate value of unsigned narrow character type is produced by the \nevaluation of the initialization expression when initializing an object of unsigned \nnarrow character type, that object is initialized to an indeterminate value. \nThe default initialization of an object is described by paragraph 7 of the same subclause: \nTo default-initialize an object of type T means: \n• \nif T is a (possibly cv-qualified) class type, the default constructor for T is called (and \nthe initialization is ill-formed if T has no default constructor or overload resolution \nresults in an ambiguity or in a function that is deleted or inaccessible from the \ncontext of the initialization); \n• \nif T is an array type, each element is default-initialized; \n• \notherwise, no initialization is performed. \nIf a program calls for the default initialization of an object of a const-qualified type T, T \nshall be a class type with a user-provided default constructor. \nExpressions (EXP) - EXP53-CPP. Do not read uninitialized memory \nSEI CERT C++ CODING STANDARD (2016 EDITION) | V01 \n \n97 \nSoftware Engineering Institute | Carnegie Mellon University  \n \n[DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A] Approved for public release and unlimited distribution. \nAs a result, objects of type T with automatic or dynamic storage duration must be explicitly \ninitialized before having their value read as part of an expression unless T is a class type or an \narray thereof or is an unsigned narrow character type. If T is an unsigned narrow character type, it \nmay be used to initialize an object of unsigned narrow character type, which results in both \nobjects having an indeterminate value. This technique can be used to implement copy operations \nsuch as std::memcpy() without triggering undefined behavior. \nAdditionally, memory dynamically allocated with a new expression is default-initialized when the \nnew-initialized is omitted. Memory allocated by the standard library function std::calloc() \nis zero-initialized. Memory allocated by the standard library function std::realloc() \nassumes the values of the original pointer but may not initialize the full range of memory. \nMemory allocated by any other means (std::malloc(), allocator objects, operator \nnew(), and so on) is assumed to be default-initialized. \nObjects of static or thread storage duration are zero-initialized before any other initialization takes \nplace [ISO/IEC 14882-2014] and need not be explicitly initialized before having their value read. \nReading uninitialized variables for creating entropy is problematic because these memory \naccesses can be removed by compiler optimization.

Write constructor member initializers in the canonical \norder \nThe member initializer list for a class constructor allows members to be initialized to specified \nvalues and for base class constructors to be called with specific arguments. However, the order in \nwhich initialization occurs is fixed and does not depend on the order written in the member \ninitializer list. The C++ Standard, [class.base.init], paragraph 11 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the \nfollowing: \nIn a non-delegating constructor, initialization proceeds in the following order: \n• \nFirst, and only for the constructor of the most derived class, virtual base classes are \ninitialized in the order they appear on a depth-first left-to-right traversal of the \ndirected acyclic graph of base classes, where “left-to-right” is the order of \nappearance of the base classes in the derived class base-specifier-list. \n• \nThen, direct base classes are initialized in declaration order as they appear in the \nbase-specifier-list (regardless of the order of the mem-initializers). \n• \nThen, non-static data members are initialized in the order they were declared in the \nclass definition (again regardless of the order of the mem-initializers). \n• \nFinally, the compound-statement of the constructor body is executed. \n[Note: The declaration order is mandated to ensure that base and member subobjects \nare destroyed in the reverse order of initialization. —end note] \nConsequently, the order in which member initializers appear in the member initializer list is \nirrelevant. The order in which members are initialized, including base class initialization, is \ndetermined by the declaration order of the class member variables or the base class specifier list. \nWriting member initializers other than in canonical order can result in undefined behavior, such as \nreading uninitialized memory. \nAlways write member initializers in a constructor in the canonical order: first, direct base classes \nin the order in which they appear in the base-specifier-list for the class, then nonstatic data \nmembers in the order in which they are declared in the class definition. \nObject Oriented Programming (OOP) - OOP53-CPP.

Copy operations must not mutate the source object \nCopy operations (copy constructors and copy assignment operators) are expected to copy the \nsalient properties of a source object into the destination object, with the resulting object being a \n“copy” of the original. What is considered to be a salient property of the type is type-dependent, \nbut for types that expose comparison or equality operators, includes any properties used for those \ncomparison operations. This expectation leads to assumptions in code that a copy operation \nresults in a destination object with a value representation that is equivalent to the source object \nvalue representation. Violation of this basic assumption can lead to unexpected behavior. \nIdeally, the copy operator should have an idiomatic signature. For copy constructors, that is \nT(const T&); and for copy assignment operators, that is T& operator=(const T&);. \nCopy constructors and copy assignment operators that do not use an idiomatic signature do not \nmeet the requirements of the CopyConstructible or CopyAssignable concept, \nrespectively. This precludes the type from being used with common standard library functionality \n[ISO/IEC 14882-2014]. \nWhen implementing a copy operator, do not mutate any externally observable members of the \nsource object operand or globally accessible information. Externally observable members include, \nbut are not limited to, members that participate in comparison or equality operations, members \nwhose values are exposed via public APIs, and global variables. \nBefore C++11, a copy operation that mutated the source operand was the only way to provide \nmove-like semantics. However, the language did not provide a way to enforce that this operation \nonly occurred when the source operand was at the end of its lifetime, which led to fragile APIs \nlike std::auto_ptr. In C++11 and later, such a situation is a good candidate for a move \noperation instead of a copy operation. \n10.9.1.1 auto_ptr \nFor example, in C++03, std::auto_ptr had the following copy operation signatures \n[ISO/IEC 14882-2003]: \nCopy constructor \nauto_ptr(auto_ptr &A); \nCopy assignment \nauto_ptr& operator=(auto_ptr &A); \nObject Oriented Programming (OOP) - OOP58-CPP.

However, this invalidated assumptions made by \nstandard library algorithms such as std::sort(), which may need to make a copy of an object \nfor later comparisons [Hinnant 2005]. Consider the following implementation of std::sort() \nthat implements the quick sort algorithm. \n// ... \nvalue_type pivot_element = *mid_point; \n// ... \nAt this point, the sorting algorithm assumes that pivot_element and *mid_point have \nequivalent value representations and will compare equal. However, for std::auto_ptr, this is \nnot the case because *mid_point has been mutated and results in unexpected behavior. \nIn C++11, the std::unique_ptr smart pointer class was introduced as a replacement for \nstd::auto_ptr to better specify the ownership semantics of pointer objects. Rather than \nmutate the source argument in a copy operation, std::unique_ptr explicitly deletes the copy \nconstructor and copy assignment operator, and instead uses a move constructor and move \nassignment operator. Subsequently, std::auto_ptr was deprecated in C++11. \nObject Oriented Programming (OOP) - OOP58-CPP.

Preserve thread safety and liveness when using \ncondition variables \nBoth thread safety and liveness are concerns when using condition variables. The thread-safety \nproperty requires that all objects maintain consistent states in a multithreaded environment [Lea \n2000]. The liveness property requires that every operation or function invocation execute to \ncompletion without interruption; for example, there is no deadlock. \nCondition variables must be used inside a while loop. (See CON54-CPP. Wrap functions that \ncan spuriously wake up in a loop for more information.) To guarantee liveness, programs must \ntest the while loop condition before invoking the condition_variable::wait() \nmember function. This early test checks whether another thread has already satisfied the condition \npredicate and has sent a notification. Invoking wait() after the notification has been sent results \nin indefinite blocking. \nTo guarantee thread safety, programs must test the while loop condition after returning from \nwait(). When a given thread invokes wait(), it will attempt to block until its condition \nvariable is signaled by a call to condition_variable::notify_all() or to \ncondition_variable::notify_one(). \nThe notify_one() member function unblocks one of the threads that are blocked on the \nspecified condition variable at the time of the call. If multiple threads are waiting on the same \ncondition variable, the scheduler can select any of those threads to be awakened (assuming that all \nthreads have the same priority level).  \nThe notify_all() member function unblocks all of the threads that are blocked on the \nspecified condition variable at the time of the call. The order in which threads execute following a \ncall to notify_all() is unspecified. Consequently, an unrelated thread could start executing, \ndiscover that its condition predicate is satisfied, and resume execution even though it was \nsupposed to remain dormant.  \nFor these reasons, threads must check the condition predicate after the wait() function returns. \nA while loop is the best choice for checking the condition predicate both before and after \ninvoking wait(). \nThe use of notify_one() is safe if each thread uses a unique condition variable. If multiple \nthreads share a condition variable, the use of notify_one() is safe only if the following \nconditions are met: \n• \nAll threads must perform the same set of operations after waking up, which means that any \nthread can be selected to wake up and resume for a single invocation of notify_one(). \n• \nOnly one thread is required to wake upon receiving the signal. \nThe notify_all() function can be used to unblock all of the threads that are blocked on the \nspecified condition variable if the use of notify_one() is unsafe. \nConcurrency (CON) - CON55-CPP.

The \ncurrentStep variable holds the current step level and is incremented when the respective \nthread completes. Finally, another thread is signaled so that the next step can be executed. Each \nthread waits until its step level is ready, and the wait() call is wrapped inside a while loop, in \ncompliance with CON54-CPP.

Each thread has its own distinct \ncondition predicate because each thread requires currentStep to have a different value before \nproceeding. When the condition variable is signaled, any of the waiting threads can wake up. The \nfollowing table illustrates a possible scenario in which the liveness property is violated.

If an indeterminate value is produced \nby an evaluation, the behavior is undefined except in the following cases: \n• \nIf an indeterminate value of unsigned narrow character type is produced by the \nevaluation of: \n    — the second or third operand of a conditional expression, \n    — the right operand of a comma expression, \n    — the operand of a cast or conversion to an unsigned narrow character type, or \n    — a discarded-value expression, \nthen the result of the operation is an indeterminate value. \n• \nIf an indeterminate value of unsigned narrow character type is produced by the \nevaluation of the right operand of a simple assignment operator whose first operand \nis an lvalue of unsigned narrow character type, an indeterminate value replaces the \nvalue of the object referred to by the left operand. \n• \nIf an indeterminate value of unsigned narrow character type is produced by the \nevaluation of the initialization expression when initializing an object of unsigned \nnarrow character type, that object is initialized to an indeterminate value. \nThe default initialization of an object is described by paragraph 7 of the same subclause: \nTo default-initialize an object of type T means: \n• \nif T is a (possibly cv-qualified) class type, the default constructor for T is called (and \nthe initialization is ill-formed if T has no default constructor or overload resolution \nresults in an ambiguity or in a function that is deleted or inaccessible from the \ncontext of the initialization); \n• \nif T is an array type, each element is default-initialized; \n• \notherwise, no initialization is performed. \nIf a program calls for the default initialization of an object of a const-qualified type T, T \nshall be a class type with a user-provided default constructor. \nExpressions (EXP) - EXP53-CPP. Do not read uninitialized memory \nSEI CERT C++ CODING STANDARD (2016 EDITION) | V01 \n \n97 \nSoftware Engineering Institute | Carnegie Mellon University  \n \n[DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A] Approved for public release and unlimited distribution. \nAs a result, objects of type T with automatic or dynamic storage duration must be explicitly \ninitialized before having their value read as part of an expression unless T is a class type or an \narray thereof or is an unsigned narrow character type. If T is an unsigned narrow character type, it \nmay be used to initialize an object of unsigned narrow character type, which results in both \nobjects having an indeterminate value. This technique can be used to implement copy operations \nsuch as std::memcpy() without triggering undefined behavior. \nAdditionally, memory dynamically allocated with a new expression is default-initialized when the \nnew-initialized is omitted. Memory allocated by the standard library function std::calloc() \nis zero-initialized. Memory allocated by the standard library function std::realloc() \nassumes the values of the original pointer but may not initialize the full range of memory. \nMemory allocated by any other means (std::malloc(), allocator objects, operator \nnew(), and so on) is assumed to be default-initialized. \nObjects of static or thread storage duration are zero-initialized before any other initialization takes \nplace [ISO/IEC 14882-2014] and need not be explicitly initialized before having their value read. \nReading uninitialized variables for creating entropy is problematic because these memory \naccesses can be removed by compiler optimization. VU#925211 is an example of a vulnerability \ncaused by this coding error [VU#925211]. \n3.4.1 \nNoncompliant Code Example \nIn this noncompliant code example, an uninitialized local variable is evaluated as part of an \nexpression to print its value, resulting in undefined behavior. \n#include <iostream> \n \nvoid f() { \n  int i; \n  std::cout << i; \n} \n3.4.2 \nCompliant Solution \nIn this compliant solution, the object is initialized prior to printing its value. \n#include <iostream> \n \nvoid f() { \n  int i = 0; \n  std::cout << i; \n} \nExpressions (EXP) - EXP53-CPP.

Write constructor member initializers in the canonical \norder \nThe member initializer list for a class constructor allows members to be initialized to specified \nvalues and for base class constructors to be called with specific arguments. However, the order in \nwhich initialization occurs is fixed and does not depend on the order written in the member \ninitializer list. The C++ Standard, [class.base.init], paragraph 11 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the \nfollowing: \nIn a non-delegating constructor, initialization proceeds in the following order: \n• \nFirst, and only for the constructor of the most derived class, virtual base classes are \ninitialized in the order they appear on a depth-first left-to-right traversal of the \ndirected acyclic graph of base classes, where “left-to-right” is the order of \nappearance of the base classes in the derived class base-specifier-list. \n• \nThen, direct base classes are initialized in declaration order as they appear in the \nbase-specifier-list (regardless of the order of the mem-initializers). \n• \nThen, non-static data members are initialized in the order they were declared in the \nclass definition (again regardless of the order of the mem-initializers). \n• \nFinally, the compound-statement of the constructor body is executed. \n[Note: The declaration order is mandated to ensure that base and member subobjects \nare destroyed in the reverse order of initialization. —end note] \nConsequently, the order in which member initializers appear in the member initializer list is \nirrelevant. The order in which members are initialized, including base class initialization, is \ndetermined by the declaration order of the class member variables or the base class specifier list. \nWriting member initializers other than in canonical order can result in undefined behavior, such as \nreading uninitialized memory. \nAlways write member initializers in a constructor in the canonical order: first, direct base classes \nin the order in which they appear in the base-specifier-list for the class, then nonstatic data \nmembers in the order in which they are declared in the class definition. \nObject Oriented Programming (OOP) - OOP53-CPP.

Do not define an unnamed namespace in a header file \nUnnamed namespaces are used to define a namespace that is unique to the translation unit, where \nthe names contained within have internal linkage by default. The C++ Standard, \n[namespace.unnamed], paragraph 1 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the following: \nAn unnamed-namespace-definition behaves as if it were replaced by: \n  inline namespace unique { /* empty body */ } \n  using namespace unique ; \n  namespace unique { namespace-body } \nwhere inline appears if and only if it appears in the unnamed-namespace-definition, \nall occurrences of unique in a translation unit are replaced by the same identifier, and \nthis identifier differs from all other identifiers in the entire program. \nProduction-quality C++ code frequently uses header files as a means to share code between \ntranslation units. A header file is any file that is inserted into a translation unit through an \n#include directive. Do not define an unnamed namespace in a header file. When an unnamed \nnamespace is defined in a header file, it can lead to surprising results. Due to default internal \nlinkage, each translation unit will define its own unique instance of members of the unnamed \nnamespace that are ODR-used within that translation unit.

Copy operations must not mutate the source object \nCopy operations (copy constructors and copy assignment operators) are expected to copy the \nsalient properties of a source object into the destination object, with the resulting object being a \n“copy” of the original. What is considered to be a salient property of the type is type-dependent, \nbut for types that expose comparison or equality operators, includes any properties used for those \ncomparison operations. This expectation leads to assumptions in code that a copy operation \nresults in a destination object with a value representation that is equivalent to the source object \nvalue representation. Violation of this basic assumption can lead to unexpected behavior. \nIdeally, the copy operator should have an idiomatic signature. For copy constructors, that is \nT(const T&); and for copy assignment operators, that is T& operator=(const T&);. \nCopy constructors and copy assignment operators that do not use an idiomatic signature do not \nmeet the requirements of the CopyConstructible or CopyAssignable concept, \nrespectively. This precludes the type from being used with common standard library functionality \n[ISO/IEC 14882-2014]. \nWhen implementing a copy operator, do not mutate any externally observable members of the \nsource object operand or globally accessible information. Externally observable members include, \nbut are not limited to, members that participate in comparison or equality operations, members \nwhose values are exposed via public APIs, and global variables. \nBefore C++11, a copy operation that mutated the source operand was the only way to provide \nmove-like semantics. However, the language did not provide a way to enforce that this operation \nonly occurred when the source operand was at the end of its lifetime, which led to fragile APIs \nlike std::auto_ptr. In C++11 and later, such a situation is a good candidate for a move \noperation instead of a copy operation. \n10.9.1.1 auto_ptr \nFor example, in C++03, std::auto_ptr had the following copy operation signatures \n[ISO/IEC 14882-2003]: \nCopy constructor \nauto_ptr(auto_ptr &A); \nCopy assignment \nauto_ptr& operator=(auto_ptr &A); \nObject Oriented Programming (OOP) - OOP58-CPP. Copy operations must not mutate the source object \nSEI CERT C++ CODING STANDARD (2016 EDITION) | V01 \n \n361 \nSoftware Engineering Institute | Carnegie Mellon University  \n \n[DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A] Approved for public release and unlimited distribution. \nBoth copy construction and copy assignment would mutate the source argument, A, by effectively \ncalling this->reset(A.release()). However, this invalidated assumptions made by \nstandard library algorithms such as std::sort(), which may need to make a copy of an object \nfor later comparisons [Hinnant 2005]. Consider the following implementation of std::sort() \nthat implements the quick sort algorithm. \n// ... \nvalue_type pivot_element = *mid_point; \n// ... \nAt this point, the sorting algorithm assumes that pivot_element and *mid_point have \nequivalent value representations and will compare equal. However, for std::auto_ptr, this is \nnot the case because *mid_point has been mutated and results in unexpected behavior. \nIn C++11, the std::unique_ptr smart pointer class was introduced as a replacement for \nstd::auto_ptr to better specify the ownership semantics of pointer objects. Rather than \nmutate the source argument in a copy operation, std::unique_ptr explicitly deletes the copy \nconstructor and copy assignment operator, and instead uses a move constructor and move \nassignment operator. Subsequently, std::auto_ptr was deprecated in C++11. \nObject Oriented Programming (OOP) - OOP58-CPP.

Preserve thread safety and liveness when using \ncondition variables \nBoth thread safety and liveness are concerns when using condition variables. The thread-safety \nproperty requires that all objects maintain consistent states in a multithreaded environment [Lea \n2000]. The liveness property requires that every operation or function invocation execute to \ncompletion without interruption; for example, there is no deadlock. \nCondition variables must be used inside a while loop. (See CON54-CPP. Wrap functions that \ncan spuriously wake up in a loop for more information.) To guarantee liveness, programs must \ntest the while loop condition before invoking the condition_variable::wait() \nmember function. This early test checks whether another thread has already satisfied the condition \npredicate and has sent a notification. Invoking wait() after the notification has been sent results \nin indefinite blocking. \nTo guarantee thread safety, programs must test the while loop condition after returning from \nwait(). When a given thread invokes wait(), it will attempt to block until its condition \nvariable is signaled by a call to condition_variable::notify_all() or to \ncondition_variable::notify_one(). \nThe notify_one() member function unblocks one of the threads that are blocked on the \nspecified condition variable at the time of the call. If multiple threads are waiting on the same \ncondition variable, the scheduler can select any of those threads to be awakened (assuming that all \nthreads have the same priority level).  \nThe notify_all() member function unblocks all of the threads that are blocked on the \nspecified condition variable at the time of the call. The order in which threads execute following a \ncall to notify_all() is unspecified. Consequently, an unrelated thread could start executing, \ndiscover that its condition predicate is satisfied, and resume execution even though it was \nsupposed to remain dormant.  \nFor these reasons, threads must check the condition predicate after the wait() function returns. \nA while loop is the best choice for checking the condition predicate both before and after \ninvoking wait(). \nThe use of notify_one() is safe if each thread uses a unique condition variable. If multiple \nthreads share a condition variable, the use of notify_one() is safe only if the following \nconditions are met: \n• \nAll threads must perform the same set of operations after waking up, which means that any \nthread can be selected to wake up and resume for a single invocation of notify_one(). \n• \nOnly one thread is required to wake upon receiving the signal. \nThe notify_all() function can be used to unblock all of the threads that are blocked on the \nspecified condition variable if the use of notify_one() is unsafe. \nConcurrency (CON) - CON55-CPP.

The \ncurrentStep variable holds the current step level and is incremented when the respective \nthread completes. Finally, another thread is signaled so that the next step can be executed. Each \nthread waits until its step level is ready, and the wait() call is wrapped inside a while loop, in \ncompliance with CON54-CPP.

Each thread has its own distinct \ncondition predicate because each thread requires currentStep to have a different value before \nproceeding. When the condition variable is signaled, any of the waiting threads can wake up. The \nfollowing table illustrates a possible scenario in which the liveness property is violated.

Do not speculatively lock a non-recursive mutex that \nis already owned by the calling thread \nThe C++ Standard Library supplies both recursive and non-recursive mutex classes used to \nprotect critical sections.

All mutex \nclasses support the ability to speculatively lock the mutex through functions such as \ntry_lock(), try_lock_for(), try_lock_until(), try_lock_shared_for (), \nand try_lock_shared_until(). These speculative locking functions attempt to obtain \nownership of the mutex for the calling thread, but will not block in the event the ownership cannot \nbe obtained. Instead, they return a Boolean value specifying whether the ownership of the mutex \nwas obtained or not. \nThe C++ Standard, [thread.mutex.requirements.mutex], paragraphs 14 and 15 [ISO/IEC 14882-\n2014], state the following: \nThe expression m.try_lock() shall be well-formed and have the following semantics: \nRequires: If m is of type std::mutex, std::timed_mutex, or \nstd::shared_timed_mutex, the calling thread does not own the mutex. \nFurther, [thread.timedmutex.class], paragraph 3, in part, states the following: \nThe behavior of a program is undefined if: \n• \na thread that owns a timed_mutex object calls lock(), try_lock(), \ntry_lock_for(), or try_lock_until() on that object \nFinally, [thread.sharedtimedmutex.class], paragraph 3, in part, states the following: \nThe behavior of a program is undefined if: \n• \na thread attempts to recursively gain any ownership of a shared_timed_mutex. \nThus, attempting to speculatively lock a non-recursive mutex object that is already owned by the \ncalling thread is undefined behavior.

Do not depend on the order of evaluation for side \neffects \nIn C++, modifying an object, calling a library I/O function, accessing a volatile-qualified \nvalue, or calling a function that performs one of these actions are ways to modify the state of the \nexecution environment. These actions are called side effects. All relationships between value \ncomputations and side effects can be described in terms of sequencing of their evaluations. The \nC++ Standard, [intro.execution], paragraph 13 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], establishes three \nsequencing terms: \nSequenced before is an asymmetric, transitive, pair-wise relation between evaluations \nexecuted by a single thread, which induces a partial order among those evaluations. \nGiven any two evaluations A and B, if A is sequenced before B, then the execution of A \nshall precede the execution of B. If A is not sequenced before B and B is not sequenced \nbefore A, then A and B are unsequenced. [Note: The execution of unsequenced \nevaluations can overlap. — end note] Evaluations A and B are indeterminately \nsequenced when either A is sequenced before B or B is sequenced before A, but it is \nunspecified which. [Note: Indeterminately sequenced evaluations cannot overlap, but \neither could be executed first. — end note] \nParagraph 15 further states (nonnormative text removed for brevity) the following: \nExcept where noted, evaluations of operands of individual operators and of \nsubexpressions of individual expressions are unsequenced. ... The value computations \nof the operands of an operator are sequenced before the value computation of the result \nof the operator. If a side effect on a scalar object is unsequenced relative to either \nanother side effect on the same scalar object or a value computation using the value of \nthe same scalar object, and they are not potentially concurrent, the behavior is \nundefined. ... When calling a function (whether or not the function is inline), every value \ncomputation and side effect associated with any argument expression, or with the postfix \nexpression designating the called function, is sequenced before execution of every \nexpression or statement in the body of the called function. ... Every evaluation in the \ncalling function (including other function calls) that is not otherwise specifically \nsequenced before or after the execution of the body of the called function is \nindeterminately sequenced with respect to the execution of the called function. Several \ncontexts in C++ cause evaluation of a function call, even though no corresponding \nfunction call syntax appears in the translation unit. ... The sequencing constraints on the \nexecution of the called function (as described above) are features of the function calls as \nevaluated, whatever the syntax of the expression that calls the function might be. \nExpressions (EXP) - EXP50-CPP.

([expr.cond], paragraph 1) \n• \nIn assignment expressions (including compound assignments), the assignment is sequenced \nafter the value computations of left and right operands and before the value computation of \nthe assignment expression. ([expr.ass], paragraph 1) \n• \nIn comma , expressions, every value computation and side effect associated with the left \nexpression is sequenced before every value computation and side effect associated with the \nright expression. ([expr.comma], paragraph 1) \n• \nWhen evaluating initializer lists, the value computation and side effect associated with each \ninitializer-clause is sequenced before every value computation and side effect associated with \na subsequent initializer-clause. ([dcl.init.list], paragraph 4) \n• \nWhen a signal handler is executed as a result of a call to std::raise(), the execution of \nthe handler is sequenced after the invocation of std::raise() and before its return. \n([intro.execution], paragraph 6) \n• \nThe completions of the destructors for all initialized objects with thread storage duration \nwithin a thread are sequenced before the initiation of the destructors of any object with static \nstorage duration.

Because the memory allocations are passed as arguments to a function call, an \nexception thrown as a result of one of the calls to new could result in a memory leak. \nstruct A { /* ... */ }; \nstruct B { /* ... */ }; \n \nvoid g(A *, B *); \nvoid f() { \n  g(new A, new B); \n} \nConsider the situation in which A is allocated and constructed first, and then B is allocated and \nthrows an exception. Wrapping the call to g() in a try/catch block is insufficient because it \nwould be impossible to free the memory allocated for A. \nThis noncompliant code example also violates EXP50-CPP.

In the situation described by the noncompliant code example, B throwing an \nexception would still result in the destruction and deallocation of the A object when then \nstd::unique_ptr<A> was destroyed. \n#include <memory> \n  \nstruct A { /* ... */ }; \nstruct B { /* ... */ };  \n  \nvoid g(std::unique_ptr<A> a, std::unique_ptr<B> b); \nvoid f() { \n  g(std::make_unique<A>(), std::make_unique<B>()); \n} \n7.3.7 \nCompliant Solution (References) \nWhen possible, the more resilient compliant solution is to remove the memory allocation entirely \nand pass the objects by reference instead. \nstruct A { /* ... */ }; \nstruct B { /* ... */ };  \n  \nvoid g(A &a, B &b); \nvoid f() { \n  A a; \n  B b; \n  g(a, b); \n} \n7.3.8 \nRisk Assessment \nFailing to detect allocation failures can lead to abnormal program termination and denial-of-\nservice attacks. \nIf the vulnerable program references memory offset from the return value, an attacker can exploit \nthe program to read or write arbitrary memory.

Use valid references, pointers, and iterators to \nreference elements of a container \nIterators are a generalization of pointers that allow a C++ program to work with different data \nstructures (containers) in a uniform manner [ISO/IEC 14882-2014]. Pointers, references, and \niterators share a close relationship in which it is required that referencing values be done through \na valid iterator, pointer, or reference. Storing an iterator, reference, or pointer to an element within \na container for any length of time comes with a risk that the underlying container may be \nmodified such that the stored iterator, pointer, or reference becomes invalid. For instance, when a \nsequence container such as std::vector requires an underlying reallocation, outstanding \niterators, pointers, and references will be invalidated [Kalev 1999]. Use only a valid pointer, \nreference, or iterator to refer to an element of a container. \nThe C++ Standard, [container.requirements.general], paragraph 12 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014] states \nthe following: \nUnless otherwise specified (either explicitly or by defining a function in terms of other \nfunctions), invoking a container member function or passing a container as an argument \nto a library function shall not invalidate iterators to, or change the values of, objects \nwithin that container. \nThe C++ Standard allows references and pointers to be invalidated independently for the same \noperation, which may result in an invalidated reference but not an invalidated pointer. However, \nrelying on this distinction is insecure because the object pointed to by the pointer may be different \nthan expected even if the pointer is valid. For instance, it is possible to retrieve a pointer to an \nelement from a container, erase that element (invalidating references when destroying the \nunderlying object), then insert a new element at the same location within the container causing the \nextant pointer to now point to a valid, but distinct object. Thus, any operation that invalidates a \npointer or a reference should be treated as though it invalidates both pointers and references. \nContainers (CTR) - CTR51-CPP.

Do not invoke virtual functions from constructors or \ndestructors \nVirtual functions allow for static dispatch of member function calls at runtime based on the \ndynamic type of the object that the member function is being called on. This convention supports \nobject-oriented programming practices commonly associated with object inheritance and function \noverriding. When calling a nonvirtual member function or when using a class member access \nexpression to denote a call, the specified function is called. Otherwise, a virtual function call is \nmade to the final overrider in the dynamic type of the object expression. \nHowever, during the construction and destruction of an object, the rules for virtual method \ndispatch on that object are restricted. The C++ Standard, [class.cdtor], paragraph 4 [ISO/IEC \n14882-2014], states the following: \nMember functions, including virtual functions, can be called during construction or \ndestruction. When a virtual function is called directly or indirectly from a constructor or \nfrom a destructor, including during the construction or destruction of the class’s non-\nstatic data members, and the object to which the call applies is the object (call it x) \nunder construction or destruction, the function called is the final overrider in the \nconstructor’s or destructor’s class and not one overriding it in a more-derived class. If the \nvirtual function call uses an explicit class member access and the object expression \nrefers to the complete object of x or one of that object’s base class subobjects but not x \nor one of its base class subobjects, the behavior is undefined. \nDo not directly or indirectly invoke a virtual function from a constructor or destructor that \nattempts to call into the object under construction or destruction. Because the order of \nconstruction starts with base classes and moves to more derived classes, attempting to call a \nderived class function from a base class under construction is dangerous. The derived class has \nnot had the opportunity to initialize its resources, which is why calling a virtual function from a \nconstructor does not result in a call to a function in a more derived class. Similarly, an object is \ndestroyed in reverse order from construction, so attempting to call a function in a more derived \nclass from a destructor may access resources that have already been released. \n \n \nObject Oriented Programming (OOP) - OOP50-CPP.

However, the \nB::B() constructor calls B::seize() rather than D::seize(). Likewise, the B::~B() \ndestructor calls B::release() rather than D::release(). \nstruct B { \n  B() { seize(); } \n  virtual ~B() { release(); } \n \nprotected: \n  virtual void seize(); \n  virtual void release(); \n}; \n \nstruct D : B { \n  virtual ~D() = default; \n \nprotected: \n  void seize() override { \n    B::seize(); \n    // Get derived resources... \n  } \n \n  void release() override { \n    // Release derived resources... \n    B::release(); \n  } \n}; \nThe result of running this code is that no derived class resources will be seized or released during \nthe initialization and destruction of object of type D. At the time of the call to seize() from \nB::B(), the D constructor has not been entered, and the behavior of the under-construction \nobject will be to invoke B::seize() rather than D::seize(). A similar situation occurs for \nthe call to release() in the base class destructor. If the functions seize() and release() \nwere declared to be pure virtual functions, the result would be undefined behavior. \nObject Oriented Programming (OOP) - OOP50-CPP.

Do not pass a nonstandard-layout type object across \nexecution boundaries \nStandard-layout types can be used to communicate with code written in other programming \nlanguages, as the layout of the type is strictly specified. The C++ Standard, [class], paragraph 7 \n[ISO/IEC 14882-2014], defines a standard-layout class as a class that \n• \ndoes not have virtual functions, \n• \nhas the same access control for all nonstatic data members, \n• \nhas no base classes of the same type as the first nonstatic data member, \n• \nhas nonstatic data members declared in only one class within the class hierarchy, and  \n• \nrecursively, does not have nonstatic data members of nonstandard-layout type. \nAn execution boundary is the delimitation between code compiled by differing compilers, \nincluding different versions of a compiler produced by the same vendor. For instance, a function \nmay be declared in a header file but defined in a library that is loaded at runtime. The execution \nboundary exists between the call site in the executable and the function implementation in the \nlibrary. Such boundaries are also called ABI (application binary interface) boundaries because \nthey relate to the interoperability of application binaries. \nDo not make any assumptions about the specific layout of objects with nonstandard-layout types. \nFor objects compiled by one compiler that are referenced by code compiled by a different \ncompiler, such assumptions cause correctness and portability concerns. The layout of the object \ngenerated by the first compiler is not guaranteed to be identical to the layout generated by the \nsecond compiler, even if both compilers are conforming C++ implementations. However, some \nimplementations may document binary compatibility guarantees that can be relied on for passing \nnonstandard-layout objects between execution boundaries. \nA special instance of this guidance involves non-C++ code compiled by a different compiler, such \nas C standard library implementations that are exposed via the C++ standard library. C standard \nlibrary functions are exposed with C++ signatures, and the type system frequently assists in \nensuring that types match appropriately. This process disallows passing a pointer to a C++ object \nto a function expecting a char * without additional work to suppress the type mismatch. \nHowever, some C standard library functions accept a void * for which any C++ pointer type \nwill suffice. Passing a pointer to a nonstandard-layout type in this situation results in \nindeterminate behavior because it depends on the behavior of the other language as well as on the \nlayout of the given object. For more information, see rule EXP56-CPP. Do not call a function \nwith a mismatched language linkage. \nPass a nonstandard-layout type object across execution boundaries only when both sides of the \nexecution boundary adhere to the same ABI. This is permissible if the same version of a compiler \nis used to compile both sides of the execution boundary, if the compiler used to compile both \nsides of the execution boundary is ABI-compatible across multiple versions, or if the differing \ncompilers document that they adhere to the same ABI. \nExpressions (EXP) - EXP60-CPP.

Therefore, the contents of library.h constitute an execution boundary. A \nnonstandard-layout type object S is passed across this execution boundary. The application \ncreates an instance of an object of this type, then passes a reference to the object to a function \ndefined by the library, crossing the execution boundary. Because the layout is not guaranteed to \nbe compatible across the boundary, this results in unexpected behavior. \n// library.h \nstruct S { \n  virtual void f() { /* ... */ } \n}; \n \nvoid func(S &s); // Implemented by the library, calls S::f() \n \n// application.cpp \n#include "library.h" \n \nvoid g() { \n  S s; \n  func(s); \n} \nThis example would be compliant if the library and the application conformed to the same ABI, \neither explicitly through vendor documentation or implicitly by virtue of using the same compiler \nversion to compile both. \n3.11.2 Compliant Solution \nBecause the library and application do not conform to the same ABI, this compliant solution \nmodifies the library and application to work with a standard-layout type.

Do not speculatively lock a non-recursive mutex that \nis already owned by the calling thread \nThe C++ Standard Library supplies both recursive and non-recursive mutex classes used to \nprotect critical sections. The recursive mutex classes (std::recursive_mutex and \nstd::recursive_timed_mutex) differ from the non-recursive mutex classes \n(std::mutex, std::timed_mutex, and std::shared_timed_mutex) in that a \nrecursive mutex may be locked recursively by the thread that currently owns the mutex. All mutex \nclasses support the ability to speculatively lock the mutex through functions such as \ntry_lock(), try_lock_for(), try_lock_until(), try_lock_shared_for (), \nand try_lock_shared_until(). These speculative locking functions attempt to obtain \nownership of the mutex for the calling thread, but will not block in the event the ownership cannot \nbe obtained. Instead, they return a Boolean value specifying whether the ownership of the mutex \nwas obtained or not. \nThe C++ Standard, [thread.mutex.requirements.mutex], paragraphs 14 and 15 [ISO/IEC 14882-\n2014], state the following: \nThe expression m.try_lock() shall be well-formed and have the following semantics: \nRequires: If m is of type std::mutex, std::timed_mutex, or \nstd::shared_timed_mutex, the calling thread does not own the mutex. \nFurther, [thread.timedmutex.class], paragraph 3, in part, states the following: \nThe behavior of a program is undefined if: \n• \na thread that owns a timed_mutex object calls lock(), try_lock(), \ntry_lock_for(), or try_lock_until() on that object \nFinally, [thread.sharedtimedmutex.class], paragraph 3, in part, states the following: \nThe behavior of a program is undefined if: \n• \na thread attempts to recursively gain any ownership of a shared_timed_mutex. \nThus, attempting to speculatively lock a non-recursive mutex object that is already owned by the \ncalling thread is undefined behavior. Do not call try_lock(), try_lock_for(), \ntry_lock_until(), try_lock_shared_for(), or try_lock_shared_until() on \na non-recursive mutex object from a thread that already owns that mutex object. \nConcurrency (CON) - CON56-CPP.

Do not depend on the order of evaluation for side \neffects \nIn C++, modifying an object, calling a library I/O function, accessing a volatile-qualified \nvalue, or calling a function that performs one of these actions are ways to modify the state of the \nexecution environment. These actions are called side effects. All relationships between value \ncomputations and side effects can be described in terms of sequencing of their evaluations. The \nC++ Standard, [intro.execution], paragraph 13 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], establishes three \nsequencing terms: \nSequenced before is an asymmetric, transitive, pair-wise relation between evaluations \nexecuted by a single thread, which induces a partial order among those evaluations. \nGiven any two evaluations A and B, if A is sequenced before B, then the execution of A \nshall precede the execution of B. If A is not sequenced before B and B is not sequenced \nbefore A, then A and B are unsequenced. [Note: The execution of unsequenced \nevaluations can overlap. — end note] Evaluations A and B are indeterminately \nsequenced when either A is sequenced before B or B is sequenced before A, but it is \nunspecified which. [Note: Indeterminately sequenced evaluations cannot overlap, but \neither could be executed first. — end note] \nParagraph 15 further states (nonnormative text removed for brevity) the following: \nExcept where noted, evaluations of operands of individual operators and of \nsubexpressions of individual expressions are unsequenced. ... The value computations \nof the operands of an operator are sequenced before the value computation of the result \nof the operator. If a side effect on a scalar object is unsequenced relative to either \nanother side effect on the same scalar object or a value computation using the value of \nthe same scalar object, and they are not potentially concurrent, the behavior is \nundefined. ... When calling a function (whether or not the function is inline), every value \ncomputation and side effect associated with any argument expression, or with the postfix \nexpression designating the called function, is sequenced before execution of every \nexpression or statement in the body of the called function. ... Every evaluation in the \ncalling function (including other function calls) that is not otherwise specifically \nsequenced before or after the execution of the body of the called function is \nindeterminately sequenced with respect to the execution of the called function. Several \ncontexts in C++ cause evaluation of a function call, even though no corresponding \nfunction call syntax appears in the translation unit. ...

Detect and handle memory allocation errors \nThe default memory allocation operator, ::operator new(std::size_t), throws a \nstd::bad_alloc exception if the allocation fails. Therefore, you need not check whether \ncalling ::operator new(std::size_t) results in nullptr. The nonthrowing form, \n::operator new(std::size_t, const std::nothrow_t &), does not throw an \nexception if the allocation fails but instead returns nullptr. The same behaviors apply for the \noperator new[] versions of both allocation functions. Additionally, the default allocator \nobject (std::allocator) uses ::operator new(std::size_t) to perform allocations \nand should be treated similarly. \nT *p1 = new T; // Throws std::bad_alloc if allocation fails \n \nT *p2 = new (std::nothrow) T; // Returns nullptr if allocation \nfails \n \nT *p3 = new T[1]; // Throws std::bad_alloc if the allocation fails \n \nT *p4 = new (std::nothrow) T[1]; // Returns nullptr if the \nallocation fails \nFurthermore, operator new[] can throw an error of type \nstd::bad_array_new_length, a subclass of std::bad_alloc, if the size argument \npassed to new is negative or excessively large. \nWhen using the nonthrowing form, it is imperative to check that the return value is not nullptr \nbefore accessing the resulting pointer. When using either form, be sure to comply with ERR50-\nCPP. Do not abruptly terminate the program. \n7.3.1 \nNoncompliant Code Example \nIn this noncompliant code example, an array of int is created using ::operator \nnew[](std::size_t) and the results of the allocation are not checked. The function is \nmarked as noexcept, so the caller assumes this function does not throw any exceptions. \nBecause ::operator new[](std::size_t) can throw an exception if the allocation fails, \nit could lead to abnormal termination of the program. \n#include <cstring> \n \nvoid f(const int *array, std::size_t size) noexcept { \n  int *copy = new int[size]; \n  std::memcpy(copy, array, size * sizeof(*copy)); \n  // ... \n  delete [] copy; \n} \nMemory Management (MEM) - MEM52-CPP.

Because the memory allocations are passed as arguments to a function call, an \nexception thrown as a result of one of the calls to new could result in a memory leak. \nstruct A { /* ... */ }; \nstruct B { /* ... */ }; \n \nvoid g(A *, B *); \nvoid f() { \n  g(new A, new B); \n} \nConsider the situation in which A is allocated and constructed first, and then B is allocated and \nthrows an exception. Wrapping the call to g() in a try/catch block is insufficient because it \nwould be impossible to free the memory allocated for A. \nThis noncompliant code example also violates EXP50-CPP.

Use valid references, pointers, and iterators to \nreference elements of a container \nIterators are a generalization of pointers that allow a C++ program to work with different data \nstructures (containers) in a uniform manner [ISO/IEC 14882-2014]. Pointers, references, and \niterators share a close relationship in which it is required that referencing values be done through \na valid iterator, pointer, or reference. Storing an iterator, reference, or pointer to an element within \na container for any length of time comes with a risk that the underlying container may be \nmodified such that the stored iterator, pointer, or reference becomes invalid. For instance, when a \nsequence container such as std::vector requires an underlying reallocation, outstanding \niterators, pointers, and references will be invalidated [Kalev 1999]. Use only a valid pointer, \nreference, or iterator to refer to an element of a container. \nThe C++ Standard, [container.requirements.general], paragraph 12 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014] states \nthe following: \nUnless otherwise specified (either explicitly or by defining a function in terms of other \nfunctions), invoking a container member function or passing a container as an argument \nto a library function shall not invalidate iterators to, or change the values of, objects \nwithin that container. \nThe C++ Standard allows references and pointers to be invalidated independently for the same \noperation, which may result in an invalidated reference but not an invalidated pointer. However, \nrelying on this distinction is insecure because the object pointed to by the pointer may be different \nthan expected even if the pointer is valid. For instance, it is possible to retrieve a pointer to an \nelement from a container, erase that element (invalidating references when destroying the \nunderlying object), then insert a new element at the same location within the container causing the \nextant pointer to now point to a valid, but distinct object. Thus, any operation that invalidates a \npointer or a reference should be treated as though it invalidates both pointers and references. \nContainers (CTR) - CTR51-CPP.

Do not invoke virtual functions from constructors or \ndestructors \nVirtual functions allow for static dispatch of member function calls at runtime based on the \ndynamic type of the object that the member function is being called on. This convention supports \nobject-oriented programming practices commonly associated with object inheritance and function \noverriding. When calling a nonvirtual member function or when using a class member access \nexpression to denote a call, the specified function is called. Otherwise, a virtual function call is \nmade to the final overrider in the dynamic type of the object expression. \nHowever, during the construction and destruction of an object, the rules for virtual method \ndispatch on that object are restricted. The C++ Standard, [class.cdtor], paragraph 4 [ISO/IEC \n14882-2014], states the following: \nMember functions, including virtual functions, can be called during construction or \ndestruction. When a virtual function is called directly or indirectly from a constructor or \nfrom a destructor, including during the construction or destruction of the class’s non-\nstatic data members, and the object to which the call applies is the object (call it x) \nunder construction or destruction, the function called is the final overrider in the \nconstructor’s or destructor’s class and not one overriding it in a more-derived class. If the \nvirtual function call uses an explicit class member access and the object expression \nrefers to the complete object of x or one of that object’s base class subobjects but not x \nor one of its base class subobjects, the behavior is undefined. \nDo not directly or indirectly invoke a virtual function from a constructor or destructor that \nattempts to call into the object under construction or destruction. Because the order of \nconstruction starts with base classes and moves to more derived classes, attempting to call a \nderived class function from a base class under construction is dangerous. The derived class has \nnot had the opportunity to initialize its resources, which is why calling a virtual function from a \nconstructor does not result in a call to a function in a more derived class. Similarly, an object is \ndestroyed in reverse order from construction, so attempting to call a function in a more derived \nclass from a destructor may access resources that have already been released. \n \n \nObject Oriented Programming (OOP) - OOP50-CPP.

However, the \nB::B() constructor calls B::seize() rather than D::seize(). Likewise, the B::~B() \ndestructor calls B::release() rather than D::release(). \nstruct B { \n  B() { seize(); } \n  virtual ~B() { release(); } \n \nprotected: \n  virtual void seize(); \n  virtual void release(); \n}; \n \nstruct D : B { \n  virtual ~D() = default; \n \nprotected: \n  void seize() override { \n    B::seize(); \n    // Get derived resources... \n  } \n \n  void release() override { \n    // Release derived resources... \n    B::release(); \n  } \n}; \nThe result of running this code is that no derived class resources will be seized or released during \nthe initialization and destruction of object of type D. At the time of the call to seize() from \nB::B(), the D constructor has not been entered, and the behavior of the under-construction \nobject will be to invoke B::seize() rather than D::seize(). A similar situation occurs for \nthe call to release() in the base class destructor. If the functions seize() and release() \nwere declared to be pure virtual functions, the result would be undefined behavior. \nObject Oriented Programming (OOP) - OOP50-CPP.

Do not pass a nonstandard-layout type object across \nexecution boundaries \nStandard-layout types can be used to communicate with code written in other programming \nlanguages, as the layout of the type is strictly specified. The C++ Standard, [class], paragraph 7 \n[ISO/IEC 14882-2014], defines a standard-layout class as a class that \n• \ndoes not have virtual functions, \n• \nhas the same access control for all nonstatic data members, \n• \nhas no base classes of the same type as the first nonstatic data member, \n• \nhas nonstatic data members declared in only one class within the class hierarchy, and  \n• \nrecursively, does not have nonstatic data members of nonstandard-layout type. \nAn execution boundary is the delimitation between code compiled by differing compilers, \nincluding different versions of a compiler produced by the same vendor. For instance, a function \nmay be declared in a header file but defined in a library that is loaded at runtime. The execution \nboundary exists between the call site in the executable and the function implementation in the \nlibrary. Such boundaries are also called ABI (application binary interface) boundaries because \nthey relate to the interoperability of application binaries. \nDo not make any assumptions about the specific layout of objects with nonstandard-layout types. \nFor objects compiled by one compiler that are referenced by code compiled by a different \ncompiler, such assumptions cause correctness and portability concerns. The layout of the object \ngenerated by the first compiler is not guaranteed to be identical to the layout generated by the \nsecond compiler, even if both compilers are conforming C++ implementations. However, some \nimplementations may document binary compatibility guarantees that can be relied on for passing \nnonstandard-layout objects between execution boundaries. \nA special instance of this guidance involves non-C++ code compiled by a different compiler, such \nas C standard library implementations that are exposed via the C++ standard library. C standard \nlibrary functions are exposed with C++ signatures, and the type system frequently assists in \nensuring that types match appropriately. This process disallows passing a pointer to a C++ object \nto a function expecting a char * without additional work to suppress the type mismatch. \nHowever, some C standard library functions accept a void * for which any C++ pointer type \nwill suffice. Passing a pointer to a nonstandard-layout type in this situation results in \nindeterminate behavior because it depends on the behavior of the other language as well as on the \nlayout of the given object. For more information, see rule EXP56-CPP. Do not call a function \nwith a mismatched language linkage. \nPass a nonstandard-layout type object across execution boundaries only when both sides of the \nexecution boundary adhere to the same ABI. This is permissible if the same version of a compiler \nis used to compile both sides of the execution boundary, if the compiler used to compile both \nsides of the execution boundary is ABI-compatible across multiple versions, or if the differing \ncompilers document that they adhere to the same ABI. \nExpressions (EXP) - EXP60-CPP.

Therefore, the contents of library.h constitute an execution boundary. A \nnonstandard-layout type object S is passed across this execution boundary. The application \ncreates an instance of an object of this type, then passes a reference to the object to a function \ndefined by the library, crossing the execution boundary. Because the layout is not guaranteed to \nbe compatible across the boundary, this results in unexpected behavior. \n// library.h \nstruct S { \n  virtual void f() { /* ... */ } \n}; \n \nvoid func(S &s); // Implemented by the library, calls S::f() \n \n// application.cpp \n#include "library.h" \n \nvoid g() { \n  S s; \n  func(s); \n} \nThis example would be compliant if the library and the application conformed to the same ABI, \neither explicitly through vendor documentation or implicitly by virtue of using the same compiler \nversion to compile both. \n3.11.2 Compliant Solution \nBecause the library and application do not conform to the same ABI, this compliant solution \nmodifies the library and application to work with a standard-layout type.

Do not read uninitialized memory \nLocal, automatic variables assume unexpected values if they are read before they are initialized. \nThe C++ Standard, [dcl.init], paragraph 12 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the following:  \nIf no initializer is specified for an object, the object is default-initialized. When storage for \nan object with automatic or dynamic storage duration is obtained, the object has an \nindeterminate value, and if no initialization is performed for the object, that object retains \nan indeterminate value until that value is replaced. If an indeterminate value is produced \nby an evaluation, the behavior is undefined except in the following cases: \n• \nIf an indeterminate value of unsigned narrow character type is produced by the \nevaluation of: \n    — the second or third operand of a conditional expression, \n    — the right operand of a comma expression, \n    — the operand of a cast or conversion to an unsigned narrow character type, or \n    — a discarded-value expression, \nthen the result of the operation is an indeterminate value. \n• \nIf an indeterminate value of unsigned narrow character type is produced by the \nevaluation of the right operand of a simple assignment operator whose first operand \nis an lvalue of unsigned narrow character type, an indeterminate value replaces the \nvalue of the object referred to by the left operand. \n• \nIf an indeterminate value of unsigned narrow character type is produced by the \nevaluation of the initialization expression when initializing an object of unsigned \nnarrow character type, that object is initialized to an indeterminate value. \nThe default initialization of an object is described by paragraph 7 of the same subclause: \nTo default-initialize an object of type T means: \n• \nif T is a (possibly cv-qualified) class type, the default constructor for T is called (and \nthe initialization is ill-formed if T has no default constructor or overload resolution \nresults in an ambiguity or in a function that is deleted or inaccessible from the \ncontext of the initialization); \n• \nif T is an array type, each element is default-initialized; \n• \notherwise, no initialization is performed. \nIf a program calls for the default initialization of an object of a const-qualified type T, T \nshall be a class type with a user-provided default constructor. \nExpressions (EXP) - EXP53-CPP. Do not read uninitialized memory \nSEI CERT C++ CODING STANDARD (2016 EDITION) | V01 \n \n97 \nSoftware Engineering Institute | Carnegie Mellon University  \n \n[DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A] Approved for public release and unlimited distribution. \nAs a result, objects of type T with automatic or dynamic storage duration must be explicitly \ninitialized before having their value read as part of an expression unless T is a class type or an \narray thereof or is an unsigned narrow character type. If T is an unsigned narrow character type, it \nmay be used to initialize an object of unsigned narrow character type, which results in both \nobjects having an indeterminate value. This technique can be used to implement copy operations \nsuch as std::memcpy() without triggering undefined behavior. \nAdditionally, memory dynamically allocated with a new expression is default-initialized when the \nnew-initialized is omitted. Memory allocated by the standard library function std::calloc() \nis zero-initialized. Memory allocated by the standard library function std::realloc() \nassumes the values of the original pointer but may not initialize the full range of memory. \nMemory allocated by any other means (std::malloc(), allocator objects, operator \nnew(), and so on) is assumed to be default-initialized. \nObjects of static or thread storage duration are zero-initialized before any other initialization takes \nplace [ISO/IEC 14882-2014] and need not be explicitly initialized before having their value read. \nReading uninitialized variables for creating entropy is problematic because these memory \naccesses can be removed by compiler optimization. VU#925211 is an example of a vulnerability \ncaused by this coding error [VU#925211]. \n3.4.1 \nNoncompliant Code Example \nIn this noncompliant code example, an uninitialized local variable is evaluated as part of an \nexpression to print its value, resulting in undefined behavior. \n#include <iostream> \n \nvoid f() { \n  int i; \n  std::cout << i; \n} \n3.4.2 \nCompliant Solution \nIn this compliant solution, the object is initialized prior to printing its value. \n#include <iostream> \n \nvoid f() { \n  int i = 0; \n  std::cout << i; \n} \nExpressions (EXP) - EXP53-CPP.

The object’s pointer value and the value it points to are \nprinted to the standard output stream. Printing the pointer value is well-defined, but attempting to \nprint the value pointed to yields an indeterminate value, resulting in undefined behavior. \n#include <iostream> \n \nvoid f() { \n  int *i = new int; \n  std::cout << i << ", " << *i; \n} \n3.4.4 \nCompliant Solution \nIn this compliant solution, the memory is direct-initialized to the value 12 prior to printing its \nvalue. \n#include <iostream> \n  \nvoid f() { \n  int *i = new int(12); \n  std::cout << i << ", " << *i; \n} \nInitialization of an object produced by a new-expression is performed by placing (possibly empty) \nparenthesis or curly braces after the type being allocated. This causes direct initialization of the \npointed-to object to occur, which will zero-initialize the object if the initialization omits a value, \nas illustrated by the following code. \nint *i = new int(); // zero-initializes *i \nint *j = new int{}; // zero-initializes *j \nint *k = new int(12); // initializes *k to 12 \nint *l = new int{12}; // initializes *l to 12 \nExpressions (EXP) - EXP53-CPP.

Avoid cycles during initialization of static objects \nThe C++ Standard, [stmt.dcl], paragraph 4 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the following: \nThe zero-initialization (8.5) of all block-scope variables with static storage duration \n(3.7.1) or thread storage duration (3.7.2) is performed before any other initialization \ntakes place. Constant initialization (3.6.2) of a block-scope entity with static storage \nduration, if applicable, is performed before its block is first entered. An implementation is \npermitted to perform early initialization of other block-scope variables with static or \nthread storage duration under the same conditions that an implementation is permitted \nto statically initialize a variable with static or thread storage duration in namespace \nscope (3.6.2). Otherwise such a variable is initialized the first time control passes \nthrough its declaration; such a variable is considered initialized upon the completion of \nits initialization. If the initialization exits by throwing an exception, the initialization is not \ncomplete, so it will be tried again the next time control enters the declaration. If control \nenters the declaration concurrently while the variable is being initialized, the concurrent \nexecution shall wait for completion of the initialization. If control re-enters the declaration \nrecursively while the variable is being initialized, the behavior is undefined. \nDo not reenter a function during the initialization of a static variable declaration. If a function is \nreentered during the constant initialization of a static object inside that function, the behavior of \nthe program is undefined. Infinite recursion is not required to trigger undefined behavior, the \nfunction need only recur once as part of the initialization. Due to thread-safe initialization of \nvariables, a single, recursive call will often result in a deadlock due to locking a non-recursive \nsynchronization primitive. \nAdditionally, the C++ Standard, [basic.start.init], paragraph 2, in part, states the following: \nDynamic initialization of a non-local variable with static storage duration is either ordered \nor unordered. Definitions of explicitly specialized class template static data members \nhave ordered initialization. Other class template static data members (i.e., implicitly or \nexplicitly instantiated specializations) have unordered initialization. Other non-local \nvariables with static storage duration have ordered initialization. Variables with ordered \ninitialization defined within a single translation unit shall be initialized in the order of their \ndefinitions in the translation unit. If a program starts a thread, the subsequent \ninitialization of a variable is unsequenced with respect to the initialization of a variable \ndefined in a different translation unit. Otherwise, the initialization of a variable is \nindeterminately sequenced with respect to the initialization of a variable defined in a \ndifferent translation unit. If a program starts a thread, the subsequent unordered \ninitialization of a variable is unsequenced with respect to every other dynamic \ninitialization. Otherwise, the unordered initialization of a variable is indeterminately \nsequenced with respect to every other dynamic initialization. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL56-CPP.

Avoid information leakage when passing a class \nobject across a trust boundary \nThe C++ Standard, [class.mem], paragraph 13 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], describes the layout of \nnon-static data members of a non-union class, specifying the following: \nNonstatic data members of a (non-union) class with the same access control are \nallocated so that later members have higher addresses within a class object. The order \nof allocation of non-static data members with different access control is unspecified. \nImplementation alignment requirements might cause two adjacent members not to be \nallocated immediately after each other; so might requirements for space for managing \nvirtual functions and virtual base classes. \nFurther, [class.bit], paragraph 1, in part, states the following: \nAllocation of bit-fields within a class object is implementation-defined. Alignment of bit-\nfields is implementation-defined. Bit-fields are packed into some addressable allocation \nunit. \nThus, padding bits may be present at any location within a class object instance (including at the \nbeginning of the object, in the case of an unnamed bit-field as the first member declared in a \nclass).

The \nfollowing solution is specific to the x86-32 architecture. \n#include <cstddef> \n \nstruct test { \n  int a; \n  char b; \n  char padding_1, padding_2, padding_3; \n  int c; \n \n  test(int a, char b, int c) : a(a), b(b), \n    padding_1(0), padding_2(0), padding_3(0), \n    c(c) {} \n}; \n// Ensure c is the next byte after the last padding byte. \nstatic_assert(offsetof(test, c) == offsetof(test, padding_3) + 1, \n              "Object contains intermediate padding"); \n// Ensure there is no trailing padding. \nstatic_assert(sizeof(test) == offsetof(test, c) + sizeof(int), \n              "Object contains trailing padding"); \n \n \n \n// Safely copy bytes to user space. \nextern int copy_to_user(void *dest, void *src, std::size_t size); \n \nvoid do_stuff(void *usr_buf) { \n  test arg{1, 2, 3}; \n  copy_to_user(usr_buf, &arg, sizeof(arg)); \n} \nThe static_assert() declaration accepts a constant expression and an error message. The \nexpression is evaluated at compile time and, if false, the compilation is terminated and the error \nmessage is used as the diagnostic. The explicit insertion of the padding bytes into the struct \nshould ensure that no additional padding bytes are added by the compiler, and consequently both \nstatic assertions should be true. However, it is necessary to validate these assumptions to ensure \nthat the solution is correct for a particular implementation. \n2.6.5 \nNoncompliant Code Example \nIn this noncompliant code example, padding bits may abound, including \n• \nalignment padding bits after a virtual method table or virtual base class data to align a \nsubsequent data member, \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL55-CPP.

Do not depend on the order of evaluation for side \neffects \nIn C++, modifying an object, calling a library I/O function, accessing a volatile-qualified \nvalue, or calling a function that performs one of these actions are ways to modify the state of the \nexecution environment. These actions are called side effects. All relationships between value \ncomputations and side effects can be described in terms of sequencing of their evaluations. The \nC++ Standard, [intro.execution], paragraph 13 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], establishes three \nsequencing terms: \nSequenced before is an asymmetric, transitive, pair-wise relation between evaluations \nexecuted by a single thread, which induces a partial order among those evaluations. \nGiven any two evaluations A and B, if A is sequenced before B, then the execution of A \nshall precede the execution of B. If A is not sequenced before B and B is not sequenced \nbefore A, then A and B are unsequenced. [Note: The execution of unsequenced \nevaluations can overlap. — end note] Evaluations A and B are indeterminately \nsequenced when either A is sequenced before B or B is sequenced before A, but it is \nunspecified which. [Note: Indeterminately sequenced evaluations cannot overlap, but \neither could be executed first. — end note] \nParagraph 15 further states (nonnormative text removed for brevity) the following: \nExcept where noted, evaluations of operands of individual operators and of \nsubexpressions of individual expressions are unsequenced. ... The value computations \nof the operands of an operator are sequenced before the value computation of the result \nof the operator. If a side effect on a scalar object is unsequenced relative to either \nanother side effect on the same scalar object or a value computation using the value of \nthe same scalar object, and they are not potentially concurrent, the behavior is \nundefined. ... When calling a function (whether or not the function is inline), every value \ncomputation and side effect associated with any argument expression, or with the postfix \nexpression designating the called function, is sequenced before execution of every \nexpression or statement in the body of the called function. ... Every evaluation in the \ncalling function (including other function calls) that is not otherwise specifically \nsequenced before or after the execution of the body of the called function is \nindeterminately sequenced with respect to the execution of the called function. Several \ncontexts in C++ cause evaluation of a function call, even though no corresponding \nfunction call syntax appears in the translation unit. ... The sequencing constraints on the \nexecution of the called function (as described above) are features of the function calls as \nevaluated, whatever the syntax of the expression that calls the function might be. \nExpressions (EXP) - EXP50-CPP.

([expr.ass], paragraph 1) \n• \nIn comma , expressions, every value computation and side effect associated with the left \nexpression is sequenced before every value computation and side effect associated with the \nright expression. ([expr.comma], paragraph 1) \n• \nWhen evaluating initializer lists, the value computation and side effect associated with each \ninitializer-clause is sequenced before every value computation and side effect associated with \na subsequent initializer-clause. ([dcl.init.list], paragraph 4) \n• \nWhen a signal handler is executed as a result of a call to std::raise(), the execution of \nthe handler is sequenced after the invocation of std::raise() and before its return. \n([intro.execution], paragraph 6) \n• \nThe completions of the destructors for all initialized objects with thread storage duration \nwithin a thread are sequenced before the initiation of the destructors of any object with static \nstorage duration.

Do not leak resources when handling exceptions \nReclaiming resources when exceptions are thrown is important. An exception being thrown may \nresult in cleanup code being bypassed or an object being left in a partially initialized state. Such a \npartially initialized object would violate basic exception safety, as described in ERR56-CPP. \nGuarantee exception safety. It is preferable that resources be reclaimed automatically, using the \nRAII design pattern [Stroustrup 2001], when objects go out of scope. This technique avoids the \nneed to write complex cleanup code when allocating resources. \nHowever, constructors do not offer the same protection. Because a constructor is involved in \nallocating resources, it does not automatically free any resources it allocates if it terminates \nprematurely. The C++ Standard, [except.ctor], paragraph 2 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the \nfollowing: \nAn object of any storage duration whose initialization or destruction is terminated by an \nexception will have destructors executed for all of its fully constructed subobjects \n(excluding the variant members of a union-like class), that is, for subobjects for which \nthe principal constructor (12.6.2) has completed execution and the destructor has not yet \nbegun execution. Similarly, if the non-delegating constructor for an object has completed \nexecution and a delegating constructor for that object exits with an exception, the \nobject’s destructor will be invoked. If the object was allocated in a new-expression, the \nmatching deallocation function (3.7.4.2, 5.3.4, 12.5), if any, is called to free the storage \noccupied by the object. \nIt is generally recommended that constructors that cannot complete their job should throw \nexceptions rather than exit normally and leave their object in an incomplete state [Cline 2009]. \nResources must not be leaked as a result of throwing an exception, including during the \nconstruction of an object. \nThis rule is a subset of MEM51-CPP.

Do not alternately input and output from a file stream \nwithout an intervening positioning call \nThe C++ Standard, [filebuf], paragraph 2 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the following: \nThe restrictions on reading and writing a sequence controlled by an object of class \nbasic_filebuf<charT, traits> are the same as for reading and writing with the \nStandard C library FILEs. \nThe C Standard, subclause 7.19.5.3, paragraph 6 [ISO/IEC 9899:1999], places the following \nrestrictions on FILE objects opened for both reading and writing: \nWhen a file is opened with update mode . . ., both input and output may be performed on \nthe associated stream. However, output shall not be directly followed by input without an \nintervening call to the fflush function or to a file positioning function (fseek, \nfsetpos, or rewind), and input shall not be directly followed by output without an \nintervening call to a file positioning function, unless the input operation encounters end-\nof-file. \nConsequently, the following scenarios can result in undefined behavior: \n• \nReceiving input from a stream directly following an output to that stream without an \nintervening call to std::basic_filebuf<T>::seekoff() if the file is not at end-of-\nfile \n• \nOutputting to a stream after receiving input from that stream without a call to \nstd::basic_filebuf<T>::seekoff() if the file is not at end-of-file \nNo other std::basic_filebuf<T> function guarantees behavior as if a call were made to a \nstandard C library file-positioning function, or std::fflush(). \nCalling std::basic_ostream<T>::seekp() or \nstd::basic_istream<T>::seekg() eventually results in a call to \nstd::basic_filebuf<T>::seekoff() for file stream positioning. Given that \nstd::basic_iostream<T> inherits from both std:: basic_ostream<T> and \nstd::basic_istream<T>, and std::fstream inherits from std::basic_iostream, \neither function is acceptable to call to ensure the file buffer is in a valid state before the \nsubsequent I/O operation. \nInput Output (FIO) - FIO50-CPP.

Detect and handle memory allocation errors \nThe default memory allocation operator, ::operator new(std::size_t), throws a \nstd::bad_alloc exception if the allocation fails. Therefore, you need not check whether \ncalling ::operator new(std::size_t) results in nullptr. The nonthrowing form, \n::operator new(std::size_t, const std::nothrow_t &), does not throw an \nexception if the allocation fails but instead returns nullptr. The same behaviors apply for the \noperator new[] versions of both allocation functions. Additionally, the default allocator \nobject (std::allocator) uses ::operator new(std::size_t) to perform allocations \nand should be treated similarly. \nT *p1 = new T; // Throws std::bad_alloc if allocation fails \n \nT *p2 = new (std::nothrow) T; // Returns nullptr if allocation \nfails \n \nT *p3 = new T[1]; // Throws std::bad_alloc if the allocation fails \n \nT *p4 = new (std::nothrow) T[1]; // Returns nullptr if the \nallocation fails \nFurthermore, operator new[] can throw an error of type \nstd::bad_array_new_length, a subclass of std::bad_alloc, if the size argument \npassed to new is negative or excessively large. \nWhen using the nonthrowing form, it is imperative to check that the return value is not nullptr \nbefore accessing the resulting pointer. When using either form, be sure to comply with ERR50-\nCPP. Do not abruptly terminate the program. \n7.3.1 \nNoncompliant Code Example \nIn this noncompliant code example, an array of int is created using ::operator \nnew[](std::size_t) and the results of the allocation are not checked. The function is \nmarked as noexcept, so the caller assumes this function does not throw any exceptions. \nBecause ::operator new[](std::size_t) can throw an exception if the allocation fails, \nit could lead to abnormal termination of the program. \n#include <cstring> \n \nvoid f(const int *array, std::size_t size) noexcept { \n  int *copy = new int[size]; \n  std::memcpy(copy, array, size * sizeof(*copy)); \n  // ... \n  delete [] copy; \n} \nMemory Management (MEM) - MEM52-CPP.

Always test the returned pointer to ensure it is not nullptr before referencing \nthe pointer. This compliant solution handles the error condition appropriately when the returned \npointer is nullptr. \n#include <cstring> \n#include <new> \n  \nvoid f(const int *array, std::size_t size) noexcept { \n  int *copy = new (std::nothrow) int[size]; \n  if (!copy) { \n    // Handle error \n    return; \n  } \n  std::memcpy(copy, array, size * sizeof(*copy)); \n  // ... \n  delete [] copy; \n} \n7.3.3 \nCompliant Solution (std::bad_alloc) \nAlternatively, you can use ::operator new[] without std::nothrow and instead catch a \nstd::bad_alloc exception if sufficient memory cannot be allocated. \n#include <cstring> \n#include <new> \n  \nvoid f(const int *array, std::size_t size) noexcept { \n  int *copy; \n  try { \n    copy = new int[size]; \n  } catch(std::bad_alloc) { \n    // Handle error \n    return; \n  } \n  // At this point, copy has been initialized to allocated memory \n  std::memcpy(copy, array, size * sizeof(*copy)); \n  // ... \n  delete [] copy; \n} \nMemory Management (MEM) - MEM52-CPP.

Because the memory allocations are passed as arguments to a function call, an \nexception thrown as a result of one of the calls to new could result in a memory leak. \nstruct A { /* ... */ }; \nstruct B { /* ... */ }; \n \nvoid g(A *, B *); \nvoid f() { \n  g(new A, new B); \n} \nConsider the situation in which A is allocated and constructed first, and then B is allocated and \nthrows an exception. Wrapping the call to g() in a try/catch block is insufficient because it \nwould be impossible to free the memory allocated for A. \nThis noncompliant code example also violates EXP50-CPP.

In the situation described by the noncompliant code example, B throwing an \nexception would still result in the destruction and deallocation of the A object when then \nstd::unique_ptr<A> was destroyed. \n#include <memory> \n  \nstruct A { /* ... */ }; \nstruct B { /* ... */ };  \n  \nvoid g(std::unique_ptr<A> a, std::unique_ptr<B> b); \nvoid f() { \n  g(std::make_unique<A>(), std::make_unique<B>()); \n} \n7.3.7 \nCompliant Solution (References) \nWhen possible, the more resilient compliant solution is to remove the memory allocation entirely \nand pass the objects by reference instead. \nstruct A { /* ... */ }; \nstruct B { /* ... */ };  \n  \nvoid g(A &a, B &b); \nvoid f() { \n  A a; \n  B b; \n  g(a, b); \n} \n7.3.8 \nRisk Assessment \nFailing to detect allocation failures can lead to abnormal program termination and denial-of-\nservice attacks. \nIf the vulnerable program references memory offset from the return value, an attacker can exploit \nthe program to read or write arbitrary memory.

However, the C++ Standard, \n[res.on.functions], paragraph 1, states the following: \nIn certain cases (replacement functions, handler functions, operations on types used to \ninstantiate standard library template components), the C++ standard library depends on \ncomponents supplied by a C++ program.

If an indeterminate value is produced \nby an evaluation, the behavior is undefined except in the following cases: \n• \nIf an indeterminate value of unsigned narrow character type is produced by the \nevaluation of: \n    — the second or third operand of a conditional expression, \n    — the right operand of a comma expression, \n    — the operand of a cast or conversion to an unsigned narrow character type, or \n    — a discarded-value expression, \nthen the result of the operation is an indeterminate value. \n• \nIf an indeterminate value of unsigned narrow character type is produced by the \nevaluation of the right operand of a simple assignment operator whose first operand \nis an lvalue of unsigned narrow character type, an indeterminate value replaces the \nvalue of the object referred to by the left operand. \n• \nIf an indeterminate value of unsigned narrow character type is produced by the \nevaluation of the initialization expression when initializing an object of unsigned \nnarrow character type, that object is initialized to an indeterminate value. \nThe default initialization of an object is described by paragraph 7 of the same subclause: \nTo default-initialize an object of type T means: \n• \nif T is a (possibly cv-qualified) class type, the default constructor for T is called (and \nthe initialization is ill-formed if T has no default constructor or overload resolution \nresults in an ambiguity or in a function that is deleted or inaccessible from the \ncontext of the initialization); \n• \nif T is an array type, each element is default-initialized; \n• \notherwise, no initialization is performed. \nIf a program calls for the default initialization of an object of a const-qualified type T, T \nshall be a class type with a user-provided default constructor. \nExpressions (EXP) - EXP53-CPP. Do not read uninitialized memory \nSEI CERT C++ CODING STANDARD (2016 EDITION) | V01 \n \n97 \nSoftware Engineering Institute | Carnegie Mellon University  \n \n[DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A] Approved for public release and unlimited distribution. \nAs a result, objects of type T with automatic or dynamic storage duration must be explicitly \ninitialized before having their value read as part of an expression unless T is a class type or an \narray thereof or is an unsigned narrow character type. If T is an unsigned narrow character type, it \nmay be used to initialize an object of unsigned narrow character type, which results in both \nobjects having an indeterminate value. This technique can be used to implement copy operations \nsuch as std::memcpy() without triggering undefined behavior. \nAdditionally, memory dynamically allocated with a new expression is default-initialized when the \nnew-initialized is omitted. Memory allocated by the standard library function std::calloc() \nis zero-initialized. Memory allocated by the standard library function std::realloc() \nassumes the values of the original pointer but may not initialize the full range of memory. \nMemory allocated by any other means (std::malloc(), allocator objects, operator \nnew(), and so on) is assumed to be default-initialized. \nObjects of static or thread storage duration are zero-initialized before any other initialization takes \nplace [ISO/IEC 14882-2014] and need not be explicitly initialized before having their value read. \nReading uninitialized variables for creating entropy is problematic because these memory \naccesses can be removed by compiler optimization. VU#925211 is an example of a vulnerability \ncaused by this coding error [VU#925211]. \n3.4.1 \nNoncompliant Code Example \nIn this noncompliant code example, an uninitialized local variable is evaluated as part of an \nexpression to print its value, resulting in undefined behavior. \n#include <iostream> \n \nvoid f() { \n  int i; \n  std::cout << i; \n} \n3.4.2 \nCompliant Solution \nIn this compliant solution, the object is initialized prior to printing its value. \n#include <iostream> \n \nvoid f() { \n  int i = 0; \n  std::cout << i; \n} \nExpressions (EXP) - EXP53-CPP.

Avoid cycles during initialization of static objects \nThe C++ Standard, [stmt.dcl], paragraph 4 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the following: \nThe zero-initialization (8.5) of all block-scope variables with static storage duration \n(3.7.1) or thread storage duration (3.7.2) is performed before any other initialization \ntakes place. Constant initialization (3.6.2) of a block-scope entity with static storage \nduration, if applicable, is performed before its block is first entered. An implementation is \npermitted to perform early initialization of other block-scope variables with static or \nthread storage duration under the same conditions that an implementation is permitted \nto statically initialize a variable with static or thread storage duration in namespace \nscope (3.6.2). Otherwise such a variable is initialized the first time control passes \nthrough its declaration; such a variable is considered initialized upon the completion of \nits initialization. If the initialization exits by throwing an exception, the initialization is not \ncomplete, so it will be tried again the next time control enters the declaration. If control \nenters the declaration concurrently while the variable is being initialized, the concurrent \nexecution shall wait for completion of the initialization. If control re-enters the declaration \nrecursively while the variable is being initialized, the behavior is undefined. \nDo not reenter a function during the initialization of a static variable declaration. If a function is \nreentered during the constant initialization of a static object inside that function, the behavior of \nthe program is undefined. Infinite recursion is not required to trigger undefined behavior, the \nfunction need only recur once as part of the initialization. Due to thread-safe initialization of \nvariables, a single, recursive call will often result in a deadlock due to locking a non-recursive \nsynchronization primitive. \nAdditionally, the C++ Standard, [basic.start.init], paragraph 2, in part, states the following: \nDynamic initialization of a non-local variable with static storage duration is either ordered \nor unordered. Definitions of explicitly specialized class template static data members \nhave ordered initialization. Other class template static data members (i.e., implicitly or \nexplicitly instantiated specializations) have unordered initialization. Other non-local \nvariables with static storage duration have ordered initialization. Variables with ordered \ninitialization defined within a single translation unit shall be initialized in the order of their \ndefinitions in the translation unit. If a program starts a thread, the subsequent \ninitialization of a variable is unsequenced with respect to the initialization of a variable \ndefined in a different translation unit. Otherwise, the initialization of a variable is \nindeterminately sequenced with respect to the initialization of a variable defined in a \ndifferent translation unit. If a program starts a thread, the subsequent unordered \ninitialization of a variable is unsequenced with respect to every other dynamic \ninitialization. Otherwise, the unordered initialization of a variable is indeterminately \nsequenced with respect to every other dynamic initialization. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL56-CPP.

Unordered initialization, especially prevalent \nacross translation unit boundaries, results in unspecified behavior. \n2.7.1 \nNoncompliant Code Example \nThis noncompliant example attempts to implement an efficient factorial function using caching. \nBecause the initialization of the static local array cache involves recursion, the behavior of the \nfunction is undefined, even though the recursion is not infinite. \n#include <stdexcept> \n \nint fact(int i) noexcept(false) { \n  if (i < 0) { \n    // Negative factorials are undefined. \n    throw std::domain_error("i must be >= 0"); \n  } \n  \n  static const int cache[] = { \n    fact(0), fact(1), fact(2), fact(3), fact(4), fact(5), \n    fact(6), fact(7), fact(8), fact(9), fact(10), fact(11), \n    fact(12), fact(13), fact(14), fact(15), fact(16) \n  }; \n  \n  if (i < (sizeof(cache) / sizeof(int))) { \n    return cache[i]; \n  } \n  \n  return i > 0 ? i * fact(i - 1) : 1; \n} \n2.7.1.1 Implementation Details \nIn Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and GCC 6.1.0, the recursive initialization of cache deadlocks \nwhile initializing the static variable in a thread-safe manner. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL56-CPP.

It then returns the cached value when possible or computes \nthe value as needed. \n#include <stdexcept> \n \nint fact(int i) noexcept(false) { \n   if (i < 0) { \n    // Negative factorials are undefined. \n    throw std::domain_error("i must be >= 0"); \n  } \n \n  // Use the lazy-initialized cache. \n  static int cache[17]; \n  if (i < (sizeof(cache) / sizeof(int))) { \n    if (0 == cache[i]) { \n      cache[i] = i > 0 ? i * fact(i - 1) : 1; \n    } \n    return cache[i]; \n  } \n \n  return i > 0 ? i * fact(i - 1) : 1; \n} \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL56-CPP.

Avoid information leakage when passing a class \nobject across a trust boundary \nThe C++ Standard, [class.mem], paragraph 13 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], describes the layout of \nnon-static data members of a non-union class, specifying the following: \nNonstatic data members of a (non-union) class with the same access control are \nallocated so that later members have higher addresses within a class object. The order \nof allocation of non-static data members with different access control is unspecified. \nImplementation alignment requirements might cause two adjacent members not to be \nallocated immediately after each other; so might requirements for space for managing \nvirtual functions and virtual base classes. \nFurther, [class.bit], paragraph 1, in part, states the following: \nAllocation of bit-fields within a class object is implementation-defined. Alignment of bit-\nfields is implementation-defined. Bit-fields are packed into some addressable allocation \nunit. \nThus, padding bits may be present at any location within a class object instance (including at the \nbeginning of the object, in the case of an unnamed bit-field as the first member declared in a \nclass). Unless initialized by zero-initialization, padding bits contain indeterminate values that may \ncontain sensitive information. \nWhen passing a pointer to a class object instance across a trust boundary to a different trusted \ndomain, the programmer must ensure that the padding bits of such an object do not contain \nsensitive information. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL55-CPP.

This solution is not portable, \nhowever, because it depends on the implementation and target memory architecture. The \nfollowing solution is specific to the x86-32 architecture. \n#include <cstddef> \n \nstruct test { \n  int a; \n  char b; \n  char padding_1, padding_2, padding_3; \n  int c; \n \n  test(int a, char b, int c) : a(a), b(b), \n    padding_1(0), padding_2(0), padding_3(0), \n    c(c) {} \n}; \n// Ensure c is the next byte after the last padding byte. \nstatic_assert(offsetof(test, c) == offsetof(test, padding_3) + 1, \n              "Object contains intermediate padding"); \n// Ensure there is no trailing padding. \nstatic_assert(sizeof(test) == offsetof(test, c) + sizeof(int), \n              "Object contains trailing padding"); \n \n \n \n// Safely copy bytes to user space. \nextern int copy_to_user(void *dest, void *src, std::size_t size); \n \nvoid do_stuff(void *usr_buf) { \n  test arg{1, 2, 3}; \n  copy_to_user(usr_buf, &arg, sizeof(arg)); \n} \nThe static_assert() declaration accepts a constant expression and an error message. The \nexpression is evaluated at compile time and, if false, the compilation is terminated and the error \nmessage is used as the diagnostic. The explicit insertion of the padding bytes into the struct \nshould ensure that no additional padding bytes are added by the compiler, and consequently both \nstatic assertions should be true.

Do not depend on the order of evaluation for side \neffects \nIn C++, modifying an object, calling a library I/O function, accessing a volatile-qualified \nvalue, or calling a function that performs one of these actions are ways to modify the state of the \nexecution environment. These actions are called side effects. All relationships between value \ncomputations and side effects can be described in terms of sequencing of their evaluations. The \nC++ Standard, [intro.execution], paragraph 13 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], establishes three \nsequencing terms: \nSequenced before is an asymmetric, transitive, pair-wise relation between evaluations \nexecuted by a single thread, which induces a partial order among those evaluations. \nGiven any two evaluations A and B, if A is sequenced before B, then the execution of A \nshall precede the execution of B. If A is not sequenced before B and B is not sequenced \nbefore A, then A and B are unsequenced. [Note: The execution of unsequenced \nevaluations can overlap. — end note] Evaluations A and B are indeterminately \nsequenced when either A is sequenced before B or B is sequenced before A, but it is \nunspecified which. [Note: Indeterminately sequenced evaluations cannot overlap, but \neither could be executed first. — end note] \nParagraph 15 further states (nonnormative text removed for brevity) the following: \nExcept where noted, evaluations of operands of individual operators and of \nsubexpressions of individual expressions are unsequenced. ... The value computations \nof the operands of an operator are sequenced before the value computation of the result \nof the operator. If a side effect on a scalar object is unsequenced relative to either \nanother side effect on the same scalar object or a value computation using the value of \nthe same scalar object, and they are not potentially concurrent, the behavior is \nundefined. ... When calling a function (whether or not the function is inline), every value \ncomputation and side effect associated with any argument expression, or with the postfix \nexpression designating the called function, is sequenced before execution of every \nexpression or statement in the body of the called function. ... Every evaluation in the \ncalling function (including other function calls) that is not otherwise specifically \nsequenced before or after the execution of the body of the called function is \nindeterminately sequenced with respect to the execution of the called function. Several \ncontexts in C++ cause evaluation of a function call, even though no corresponding \nfunction call syntax appears in the translation unit. ... The sequencing constraints on the \nexecution of the called function (as described above) are features of the function calls as \nevaluated, whatever the syntax of the expression that calls the function might be. \nExpressions (EXP) - EXP50-CPP.

([expr.ass], paragraph 1) \n• \nIn comma , expressions, every value computation and side effect associated with the left \nexpression is sequenced before every value computation and side effect associated with the \nright expression. ([expr.comma], paragraph 1) \n• \nWhen evaluating initializer lists, the value computation and side effect associated with each \ninitializer-clause is sequenced before every value computation and side effect associated with \na subsequent initializer-clause. ([dcl.init.list], paragraph 4) \n• \nWhen a signal handler is executed as a result of a call to std::raise(), the execution of \nthe handler is sequenced after the invocation of std::raise() and before its return. \n([intro.execution], paragraph 6) \n• \nThe completions of the destructors for all initialized objects with thread storage duration \nwithin a thread are sequenced before the initiation of the destructors of any object with static \nstorage duration.

Do not leak resources when handling exceptions \nReclaiming resources when exceptions are thrown is important. An exception being thrown may \nresult in cleanup code being bypassed or an object being left in a partially initialized state. Such a \npartially initialized object would violate basic exception safety, as described in ERR56-CPP. \nGuarantee exception safety. It is preferable that resources be reclaimed automatically, using the \nRAII design pattern [Stroustrup 2001], when objects go out of scope. This technique avoids the \nneed to write complex cleanup code when allocating resources. \nHowever, constructors do not offer the same protection. Because a constructor is involved in \nallocating resources, it does not automatically free any resources it allocates if it terminates \nprematurely. The C++ Standard, [except.ctor], paragraph 2 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the \nfollowing: \nAn object of any storage duration whose initialization or destruction is terminated by an \nexception will have destructors executed for all of its fully constructed subobjects \n(excluding the variant members of a union-like class), that is, for subobjects for which \nthe principal constructor (12.6.2) has completed execution and the destructor has not yet \nbegun execution. Similarly, if the non-delegating constructor for an object has completed \nexecution and a delegating constructor for that object exits with an exception, the \nobject’s destructor will be invoked. If the object was allocated in a new-expression, the \nmatching deallocation function (3.7.4.2, 5.3.4, 12.5), if any, is called to free the storage \noccupied by the object. \nIt is generally recommended that constructors that cannot complete their job should throw \nexceptions rather than exit normally and leave their object in an incomplete state [Cline 2009]. \nResources must not be leaked as a result of throwing an exception, including during the \nconstruction of an object. \nThis rule is a subset of MEM51-CPP.

Preserve thread safety and liveness when using \ncondition variables \nBoth thread safety and liveness are concerns when using condition variables. The thread-safety \nproperty requires that all objects maintain consistent states in a multithreaded environment [Lea \n2000]. The liveness property requires that every operation or function invocation execute to \ncompletion without interruption; for example, there is no deadlock. \nCondition variables must be used inside a while loop. (See CON54-CPP. Wrap functions that \ncan spuriously wake up in a loop for more information.) To guarantee liveness, programs must \ntest the while loop condition before invoking the condition_variable::wait() \nmember function. This early test checks whether another thread has already satisfied the condition \npredicate and has sent a notification. Invoking wait() after the notification has been sent results \nin indefinite blocking. \nTo guarantee thread safety, programs must test the while loop condition after returning from \nwait(). When a given thread invokes wait(), it will attempt to block until its condition \nvariable is signaled by a call to condition_variable::notify_all() or to \ncondition_variable::notify_one(). \nThe notify_one() member function unblocks one of the threads that are blocked on the \nspecified condition variable at the time of the call. If multiple threads are waiting on the same \ncondition variable, the scheduler can select any of those threads to be awakened (assuming that all \nthreads have the same priority level).  \nThe notify_all() member function unblocks all of the threads that are blocked on the \nspecified condition variable at the time of the call. The order in which threads execute following a \ncall to notify_all() is unspecified. Consequently, an unrelated thread could start executing, \ndiscover that its condition predicate is satisfied, and resume execution even though it was \nsupposed to remain dormant.  \nFor these reasons, threads must check the condition predicate after the wait() function returns. \nA while loop is the best choice for checking the condition predicate both before and after \ninvoking wait(). \nThe use of notify_one() is safe if each thread uses a unique condition variable. If multiple \nthreads share a condition variable, the use of notify_one() is safe only if the following \nconditions are met: \n• \nAll threads must perform the same set of operations after waking up, which means that any \nthread can be selected to wake up and resume for a single invocation of notify_one(). \n• \nOnly one thread is required to wake upon receiving the signal. \nThe notify_all() function can be used to unblock all of the threads that are blocked on the \nspecified condition variable if the use of notify_one() is unsafe. \nConcurrency (CON) - CON55-CPP.

The \ncurrentStep variable holds the current step level and is incremented when the respective \nthread completes. Finally, another thread is signaled so that the next step can be executed. Each \nthread waits until its step level is ready, and the wait() call is wrapped inside a while loop, in \ncompliance with CON54-CPP. Wrap functions that can spuriously wake up in a loop. \n#include <condition_variable> \n#include <iostream> \n#include <mutex> \n#include <thread> \n \nstd::mutex mutex; \nstd::condition_variable cond; \n \nvoid run_step(size_t myStep) { \n  static size_t currentStep = 0; \n  std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk(mutex); \n \n  std::cout << "Thread " << myStep << " has the lock" << std::endl; \n \n  while (currentStep != myStep) { \n    std::cout << "Thread " << myStep << " is sleeping..."  \n              << std::endl; \n    cond.wait(lk); \n    std::cout << "Thread " << myStep << " woke up" << std::endl; \n  } \n \n  // Do processing... \n  std::cout << "Thread " << myStep << " is processing..."  \n            << std::endl; \n  currentStep++; \n \n  // Signal awaiting task. \n  cond.notify_one(); \n \n  std::cout << "Thread " << myStep << " is exiting..."  \n            << std::endl; \n} \n \nint main() { \n  constexpr size_t numThreads = 5; \n  std::thread threads[numThreads]; \n \n  // Create threads. \n  for (size_t i = 0; i < numThreads; ++i) { \n    threads[i] = std::thread(run_step, i); \nConcurrency (CON) - CON55-CPP.

Each thread has its own distinct \ncondition predicate because each thread requires currentStep to have a different value before \nproceeding. When the condition variable is signaled, any of the waiting threads can wake up. The \nfollowing table illustrates a possible scenario in which the liveness property is violated. If, by \nchance, the notified thread is not the thread with the next step value, that thread will wait again. \nNo additional notifications can occur, and eventually the pool of available threads will be \nexhausted. \nDeadlock: Out-of-Sequence Step Value \nTime \nThread # \n(my_step) \ncurrent_step \nAction \n0 \n3 \n0 \nThread 3 executes the first time: the predicate is false -> \nwait() \n1 \n2 \n0 \nThread 2 executes the first time: the predicate is false -> \nwait() \n2 \n4 \n0 \nThread 4 executes the first time: the predicate is false -> \nwait() \n3 \n0 \n0 \nThread 0 executes the first time: the predicate is true -> \ncurrentStep++; notify_one() \n4 \n1 \n1 \nThread 1 executes the first time: the predicate is true -> \ncurrentStep++; notify_one() \n5 \n3 \n2 \nThread 3 wakes up (scheduler choice): the predicate is \nfalse -> wait() \n6 \n— \n— \nThread exhaustion!

The behavior of any function other than a POF used as a \nsignal handler in a C++ program is implementation-defined.228 \nFootnote 228 states the following: \nIn particular, a signal handler using exception handling is very likely to have problems. \nAlso, invoking std::exit may cause destruction of objects, including those of the \nstandard library implementation, which, in general, yields undefined behavior in a signal \nhandler. \nIf your signal handler is not a plain old function, then the behavior of a call to it in response to a \nsignal is implementation-defined, at best, and is likely to result in undefined behavior. All signal \nhandlers must meet the definition of a plain old function. In addition to the restrictions placed on \nsignal handlers in a C program, this definition also prohibits the use of features that exist in C++ \nbut not in C (such as non-POD [non–plain old data] objects and exceptions). This includes \nindirect use of such features through function calls.  \n12.5.1 Noncompliant Code Example \nIn this noncompliant code example, the signal handler is declared as a static function. \nHowever, since all signal handler functions must have C language linkage, and C++ is the default \nlanguage linkage for functions in C++, calling the signal handler results in undefined behavior. \n#include <csignal> \n \nstatic void sig_handler(int sig) { \n  // Implementation details elided. \n} \n \nvoid install_signal_handler() { \n  if (SIG_ERR == std::signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler)) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \nMiscellaneous (MSC) - MSC54-CPP.

As a \nconsequence of declaring the signal handler with C language linkage, the signal handler will have \nexternal linkage rather than internal linkage. \n#include <csignal> \n  \nextern "C" void sig_handler(int sig) { \n  // Implementation details elided. \n} \n \nvoid install_signal_handler() { \n  if (SIG_ERR == std::signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler)) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \n12.5.3 Noncompliant Code Example \nIn this noncompliant code example, a signal handler calls a function that allows exceptions, and it \nattempts to handle any exceptions thrown. Because exceptions are not part of the common subset \nof C and C++ features, this example results in implementation-defined behavior. However, it is \nunlikely that the implementation’s behavior will be suitable. For instance, on a stack-based \narchitecture where a signal is generated asynchronously (instead of as a result of a call to \nstd:abort() or std::raise()), it is possible that the stack frame is not properly \ninitialized, causing stack tracing to be unreliable and preventing the exception from being caught \nproperly. \n#include <csignal> \n \nstatic void g() noexcept(false); \n \nextern "C" void sig_handler(int sig) { \n  try { \n    g(); \n  } catch (...) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \n \nvoid install_signal_handler() { \n  if (SIG_ERR == std::signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler)) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \nMiscellaneous (MSC) - MSC54-CPP.

Even if g() were implemented such that it handled all exceptions and was \nmarked noexcept(true), it would still be noncompliant to call g()from a signal handler \nbecause g() would still use a feature that is not a part of the common subset of C and C++ \nfeatures allowed by a signal handler. Therefore, this compliant solution removes the call to g() \nfrom the signal handler and instead polls a variable of type volatile sig_atomic_t \nperiodically; if the variable is set to 1 in the signal handler, then g() is called to respond to the \nsignal. \n#include <csignal> \n \nvolatile sig_atomic_t signal_flag = 0; \nstatic void g() noexcept(false); \n \nextern "C" void sig_handler(int sig) { \n  signal_flag = 1; \n} \n \nvoid install_signal_handler() { \n  if (SIG_ERR == std::signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler)) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \n \n// Called periodically to poll the signal flag. \nvoid poll_signal_flag() { \n  if (signal_flag == 1) { \n    signal_flag = 0; \n    try { \n      g(); \n    } catch(...) { \n      // Handle error \n    } \n  } \n} \nMiscellaneous (MSC) - MSC54-CPP.

Obey the one-definition rule \nNontrivial C++ programs are generally divided into multiple translation units that are later linked \ntogether to form an executable. To support such a model, C++ restricts named object definitions \nto ensure that linking will behave deterministically by requiring a single definition for an object \nacross all translation units. This model is called the one-definition rule (ODR), which is defined \nby the C++ Standard, [basic.def.odr] in paragraph 4 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014]: \nEvery program shall contain exactly one definition of every non-inline function or variable \nthat is odr-used in that program; no diagnostic required. The definition can appear \nexplicitly in the program, it can be found in the standard or a user-defined library, or \n(when appropriate) it is implicitly defined. An inline function shall be defined in every \ntranslation unit in which it is odr-used. \nThe most common approach to multitranslation unit compilation involves declarations residing in \na header file that is subsequently made available to a source file via #include. These \ndeclarations are often also definitions, such as class and function template definitions. This \napproach is allowed by an exception defined in paragraph 6, which, in part, states the following: \nThere can be more than one definition of a class type, enumeration type, inline function \nwith external linkage, class template, non-static function template, static data member of \na class template, member function of a class template, or template specialization for \nwhich some template parameters are not specified in a program provided that each \ndefinition appears in a different translation unit, and provided the definitions satisfy the \nfollowing requirements. Given such an entity named D defined in more than one \ntranslation unit.... \nIf the definitions of D satisfy all these requirements, then the program shall behave as if \nthere were a single definition of D. If the definitions of D do not satisfy these \nrequirements, then the behavior is undefined. \nThe requirements specified by paragraph 6 essentially state that that two definitions must be \nidentical (not simply equivalent). Consequently, a definition introduced in two separate translation \nunits by an #include directive generally will not violate the ODR because the definitions are \nidentical in both translation units. \nHowever, it is possible to violate the ODR of a definition introduced via #include using block \nlanguage linkage specifications, vendor-specific language extensions, and so on. A more likely \nscenario for ODR violations is that accidental definitions of differing objects will exist in different \ntranslation units. \nDo not violate the one-definition rule; violations result in undefined behavior. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

Although the two definitions are functionally equivalent (they both \ndefine a class named S with a single, public, nonstatic data member int a), they are not defined \nusing the same sequence of tokens.

If the programmer intends for the same \nclass definition to be visible in both translation units because of common usage, the solution is to \nuse a header file to introduce the object into both translation units, as shown in this compliant \nsolution. \n// S.h \nstruct S { \n  int a; \n}; \n \n// a.cpp \n#include "S.h" \n  \n// b.cpp \n#include "S.h" \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

However, one of the translation units uses an implementation-defined #pragma that \nis supported by Microsoft Visual Studio to specify structure field alignment requirements. \nConsequently, the two class definitions may have differing layouts in each translation unit, which \nis a violation of the ODR. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

Consequently, when init_s() initializes the data members of s, it may result in a \nbuffer overrun. \nFor more information on the behavior of #pragma pack, see the vendor documentation for \nyour implementation, such as Microsoft Visual Studio or GCC. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

Because f() is declared as an inline function, the \ndefinition of f() must be identical in all translation units. However, each translation unit has a \nunique instance of n, resulting in a violation of the ODR. \nconst int n = 42; \n \nint g(const int &lhs, const int &rhs); \n  \ninline int f(int k) { \n  return g(k, n); \n} \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

This solution is compliant but it is not ideal. It may not be possible (or \ndesirable) to modify the signature of g(), such as if g() represented std::max() from \n<algorithm>. Also, because of the differing linkage used by n and f(), accidental violations \nof the ODR are still likely if the definition of f() is modified to odr-use n. \nconst int n = 42; \n \nint g(int lhs, int rhs); \n  \ninline int f(int k) { \n  return g(k, n); \n} \n2.11.8 Compliant Solution \nIn this compliant solution, the constant object n is replaced with an enumerator of the same name. \nNamed enumerations defined at namespace scope have the same linkage as the namespace they \nare contained in. The global namespace has external linkage, so the definition of the named \nenumeration and its contained enumerators also have external linkage. Although less aesthetically \npleasing, this compliant solution does not suffer from the same maintenance burdens of the \nprevious code because n and f() have the same linkage. \nenum Constants { \n  N = 42 \n}; \n \nint g(const int &lhs, const int &rhs); \n  \ninline int f(int k) { \n  return g(k, N); \n} \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

As shown in “Support for Whole-Program Analysis and the Verification of the \nOne-Definition Rule in C++” [Quinlan 2006], failing to enforce the ODR enables a virtual \nfunction pointer attack known as the VPTR exploit.

Avoid cycles during initialization of static objects \nThe C++ Standard, [stmt.dcl], paragraph 4 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the following: \nThe zero-initialization (8.5) of all block-scope variables with static storage duration \n(3.7.1) or thread storage duration (3.7.2) is performed before any other initialization \ntakes place. Constant initialization (3.6.2) of a block-scope entity with static storage \nduration, if applicable, is performed before its block is first entered. An implementation is \npermitted to perform early initialization of other block-scope variables with static or \nthread storage duration under the same conditions that an implementation is permitted \nto statically initialize a variable with static or thread storage duration in namespace \nscope (3.6.2). Otherwise such a variable is initialized the first time control passes \nthrough its declaration; such a variable is considered initialized upon the completion of \nits initialization. If the initialization exits by throwing an exception, the initialization is not \ncomplete, so it will be tried again the next time control enters the declaration. If control \nenters the declaration concurrently while the variable is being initialized, the concurrent \nexecution shall wait for completion of the initialization. If control re-enters the declaration \nrecursively while the variable is being initialized, the behavior is undefined. \nDo not reenter a function during the initialization of a static variable declaration. If a function is \nreentered during the constant initialization of a static object inside that function, the behavior of \nthe program is undefined. Infinite recursion is not required to trigger undefined behavior, the \nfunction need only recur once as part of the initialization. Due to thread-safe initialization of \nvariables, a single, recursive call will often result in a deadlock due to locking a non-recursive \nsynchronization primitive. \nAdditionally, the C++ Standard, [basic.start.init], paragraph 2, in part, states the following: \nDynamic initialization of a non-local variable with static storage duration is either ordered \nor unordered. Definitions of explicitly specialized class template static data members \nhave ordered initialization. Other class template static data members (i.e., implicitly or \nexplicitly instantiated specializations) have unordered initialization. Other non-local \nvariables with static storage duration have ordered initialization. Variables with ordered \ninitialization defined within a single translation unit shall be initialized in the order of their \ndefinitions in the translation unit. If a program starts a thread, the subsequent \ninitialization of a variable is unsequenced with respect to the initialization of a variable \ndefined in a different translation unit. Otherwise, the initialization of a variable is \nindeterminately sequenced with respect to the initialization of a variable defined in a \ndifferent translation unit. If a program starts a thread, the subsequent unordered \ninitialization of a variable is unsequenced with respect to every other dynamic \ninitialization. Otherwise, the unordered initialization of a variable is indeterminately \nsequenced with respect to every other dynamic initialization. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL56-CPP.

Ensure your random number generator is properly \nseeded \nA pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) is a deterministic algorithm capable of generating \nsequences of numbers that approximate the properties of random numbers. Each sequence is \ncompletely determined by the initial state of the PRNG and the algorithm for changing the state. \nMost PRNGs make it possible to set the initial state, also called the seed state. Setting the initial \nstate is called seeding the PRNG. \nCalling a PRNG in the same initial state, either without seeding it explicitly or by seeding it with a \nconstant value, results in generating the same sequence of random numbers in different runs of the \nprogram. Consider a PRNG function that is seeded with some initial seed value and is \nconsecutively called to produce a sequence of random numbers. If the PRNG is subsequently \nseeded with the same initial seed value, then it will generate the same sequence. \nConsequently, after the first run of an improperly seeded PRNG, an attacker can predict the \nsequence of random numbers that will be generated in the future runs. Improperly seeding or \nfailing to seed the PRNG can lead to vulnerabilities, especially in security protocols. \nThe solution is to ensure that a PRNG is always properly seeded with an initial seed value that \nwill not be predictable or controllable by an attacker. A properly seeded PRNG will generate a \ndifferent sequence of random numbers each time it is run. \nNot all random number generators can be seeded. True random number generators that rely on \nhardware to produce completely unpredictable results do not need to be and cannot be seeded. \nSome high-quality PRNGs, such as the /dev/random device on some UNIX systems, also \ncannot be seeded. This rule applies only to algorithmic PRNGs that can be seeded. \n12.2.1 Noncompliant Code Example \nThis noncompliant code example generates a sequence of 10 pseudorandom numbers using the \nMersenne Twister engine. No matter how many times this code is executed, it always produces \nthe same sequence because the default seed is used for the engine. \n#include <random> \n#include <iostream> \n \nvoid f() { \n  std::mt19937 engine; \n   \n  for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) { \n    std::cout << engine() << ", "; \n  } \n} \nMiscellaneous (MSC) - MSC51-CPP.

Prevent data races when accessing bit-fields from \nmultiple threads \nWhen accessing a bit-field, a thread may inadvertently access a separate bit-field in adjacent \nmemory. This is because compilers are required to store multiple adjacent bit-fields in one storage \nunit whenever they fit. Consequently, data races may exist not just on a bit-field accessed by \nmultiple threads but also on other bit-fields sharing the same byte or word. The problem is \ndifficult to diagnose because it may not be obvious that the same memory location is being \nmodified by multiple threads. \nOne approach for preventing data races in concurrent programming is to use a mutex. When \nproperly observed by all threads, a mutex can provide safe and secure access to a shared object. \nHowever, mutexes provide no guarantees with regard to other objects that might be accessed \nwhen the mutex is not controlled by the accessing thread. Unfortunately, there is no portable way \nto determine which adjacent bit-fields may be stored along with the desired bit-field. \nAnother approach is to insert a non-bit-field member between any two bit-fields to ensure that \neach bit-field is the only one accessed within its storage unit. This technique effectively \nguarantees that no two bit-fields are accessed simultaneously. \n11.3.1 Noncompliant Code Example (bit-field) \nAdjacent bit-fields may be stored in a single memory location. Consequently, modifying adjacent \nbit-fields in different threads is undefined behavior, as shown in this noncompliant code example. \nstruct MultiThreadedFlags { \n  unsigned int flag1 : 2; \n  unsigned int flag2 : 2; \n}; \n \nMultiThreadedFlags flags; \n \nvoid thread1() { \n  flags.flag1 = 1; \n} \n \nvoid thread2() { \n  flags.flag2 = 2; \n} \nConcurrency (CON) - CON52-CPP.

The same applies to two bit-fields, if one is declared inside a nested struct \ndeclaration and the other is not, or if the two are separated by a zero-length bit-field \ndeclaration, or if they are separated by a non-bit-field declaration.  It is not safe to \nconcurrently update two bit-fields in the same struct if all fields between them are also \nbit-fields of non-zero width.  – end note ] \nIt is almost certain that flag1 and flag2 are stored in the same word. Using a compiler that \nconforms to earlier versions of the standard, if both assignments occur on a thread-scheduling \ninterleaving that ends with both stores occurring after one another, it is possible that only one of \nthe flags will be set as intended, and the other flag will contain its previous value because both \nmembers are represented by the same word, which is the smallest unit the processor can work on. \nBefore the changes made to the C++ Standard for C++11, there were no guarantees that these \nflags could be modified concurrently. \nConcurrency (CON) - CON52-CPP.

Preserve thread safety and liveness when using \ncondition variables \nBoth thread safety and liveness are concerns when using condition variables. The thread-safety \nproperty requires that all objects maintain consistent states in a multithreaded environment [Lea \n2000]. The liveness property requires that every operation or function invocation execute to \ncompletion without interruption; for example, there is no deadlock. \nCondition variables must be used inside a while loop. (See CON54-CPP. Wrap functions that \ncan spuriously wake up in a loop for more information.) To guarantee liveness, programs must \ntest the while loop condition before invoking the condition_variable::wait() \nmember function. This early test checks whether another thread has already satisfied the condition \npredicate and has sent a notification. Invoking wait() after the notification has been sent results \nin indefinite blocking. \nTo guarantee thread safety, programs must test the while loop condition after returning from \nwait(). When a given thread invokes wait(), it will attempt to block until its condition \nvariable is signaled by a call to condition_variable::notify_all() or to \ncondition_variable::notify_one(). \nThe notify_one() member function unblocks one of the threads that are blocked on the \nspecified condition variable at the time of the call. If multiple threads are waiting on the same \ncondition variable, the scheduler can select any of those threads to be awakened (assuming that all \nthreads have the same priority level).  \nThe notify_all() member function unblocks all of the threads that are blocked on the \nspecified condition variable at the time of the call. The order in which threads execute following a \ncall to notify_all() is unspecified. Consequently, an unrelated thread could start executing, \ndiscover that its condition predicate is satisfied, and resume execution even though it was \nsupposed to remain dormant.  \nFor these reasons, threads must check the condition predicate after the wait() function returns. \nA while loop is the best choice for checking the condition predicate both before and after \ninvoking wait(). \nThe use of notify_one() is safe if each thread uses a unique condition variable. If multiple \nthreads share a condition variable, the use of notify_one() is safe only if the following \nconditions are met: \n• \nAll threads must perform the same set of operations after waking up, which means that any \nthread can be selected to wake up and resume for a single invocation of notify_one(). \n• \nOnly one thread is required to wake upon receiving the signal. \nThe notify_all() function can be used to unblock all of the threads that are blocked on the \nspecified condition variable if the use of notify_one() is unsafe. \nConcurrency (CON) - CON55-CPP.

The \ncurrentStep variable holds the current step level and is incremented when the respective \nthread completes. Finally, another thread is signaled so that the next step can be executed. Each \nthread waits until its step level is ready, and the wait() call is wrapped inside a while loop, in \ncompliance with CON54-CPP.

Each thread has its own distinct \ncondition predicate because each thread requires currentStep to have a different value before \nproceeding. When the condition variable is signaled, any of the waiting threads can wake up. The \nfollowing table illustrates a possible scenario in which the liveness property is violated. If, by \nchance, the notified thread is not the thread with the next step value, that thread will wait again. \nNo additional notifications can occur, and eventually the pool of available threads will be \nexhausted. \nDeadlock: Out-of-Sequence Step Value \nTime \nThread # \n(my_step) \ncurrent_step \nAction \n0 \n3 \n0 \nThread 3 executes the first time: the predicate is false -> \nwait() \n1 \n2 \n0 \nThread 2 executes the first time: the predicate is false -> \nwait() \n2 \n4 \n0 \nThread 4 executes the first time: the predicate is false -> \nwait() \n3 \n0 \n0 \nThread 0 executes the first time: the predicate is true -> \ncurrentStep++; notify_one() \n4 \n1 \n1 \nThread 1 executes the first time: the predicate is true -> \ncurrentStep++; notify_one() \n5 \n3 \n2 \nThread 3 wakes up (scheduler choice): the predicate is \nfalse -> wait() \n6 \n— \n— \nThread exhaustion!

A signal handler must be a plain old function \nThe C++ Standard, [support.runtime], paragraph 10 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the following: \nThe common subset of the C and C++ languages consists of all declarations, definitions, \nand expressions that may appear in a well formed C++ program and also in a \nconforming C program. A POF (“plain old function”) is a function that uses only features \nfrom this common subset, and that does not directly or indirectly use any function that is \nnot a POF, except that it may use plain lock-free atomic operations. A plain lock-free \natomic operation is an invocation of a function f from Clause 29, such that f is not a \nmember function, and either f is the function atomic_is_lock_free, or for every \natomic argument A passed to f, atomic_is_lock_free(A) yields true. All signal \nhandlers shall have C linkage. The behavior of any function other than a POF used as a \nsignal handler in a C++ program is implementation-defined.228 \nFootnote 228 states the following: \nIn particular, a signal handler using exception handling is very likely to have problems. \nAlso, invoking std::exit may cause destruction of objects, including those of the \nstandard library implementation, which, in general, yields undefined behavior in a signal \nhandler. \nIf your signal handler is not a plain old function, then the behavior of a call to it in response to a \nsignal is implementation-defined, at best, and is likely to result in undefined behavior. All signal \nhandlers must meet the definition of a plain old function. In addition to the restrictions placed on \nsignal handlers in a C program, this definition also prohibits the use of features that exist in C++ \nbut not in C (such as non-POD [non–plain old data] objects and exceptions). This includes \nindirect use of such features through function calls.  \n12.5.1 Noncompliant Code Example \nIn this noncompliant code example, the signal handler is declared as a static function. \nHowever, since all signal handler functions must have C language linkage, and C++ is the default \nlanguage linkage for functions in C++, calling the signal handler results in undefined behavior. \n#include <csignal> \n \nstatic void sig_handler(int sig) { \n  // Implementation details elided. \n} \n \nvoid install_signal_handler() { \n  if (SIG_ERR == std::signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler)) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \nMiscellaneous (MSC) - MSC54-CPP.

As a \nconsequence of declaring the signal handler with C language linkage, the signal handler will have \nexternal linkage rather than internal linkage. \n#include <csignal> \n  \nextern "C" void sig_handler(int sig) { \n  // Implementation details elided. \n} \n \nvoid install_signal_handler() { \n  if (SIG_ERR == std::signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler)) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \n12.5.3 Noncompliant Code Example \nIn this noncompliant code example, a signal handler calls a function that allows exceptions, and it \nattempts to handle any exceptions thrown. Because exceptions are not part of the common subset \nof C and C++ features, this example results in implementation-defined behavior. However, it is \nunlikely that the implementation’s behavior will be suitable. For instance, on a stack-based \narchitecture where a signal is generated asynchronously (instead of as a result of a call to \nstd:abort() or std::raise()), it is possible that the stack frame is not properly \ninitialized, causing stack tracing to be unreliable and preventing the exception from being caught \nproperly. \n#include <csignal> \n \nstatic void g() noexcept(false); \n \nextern "C" void sig_handler(int sig) { \n  try { \n    g(); \n  } catch (...) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \n \nvoid install_signal_handler() { \n  if (SIG_ERR == std::signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler)) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \nMiscellaneous (MSC) - MSC54-CPP.

Even if g() were implemented such that it handled all exceptions and was \nmarked noexcept(true), it would still be noncompliant to call g()from a signal handler \nbecause g() would still use a feature that is not a part of the common subset of C and C++ \nfeatures allowed by a signal handler. Therefore, this compliant solution removes the call to g() \nfrom the signal handler and instead polls a variable of type volatile sig_atomic_t \nperiodically; if the variable is set to 1 in the signal handler, then g() is called to respond to the \nsignal. \n#include <csignal> \n \nvolatile sig_atomic_t signal_flag = 0; \nstatic void g() noexcept(false); \n \nextern "C" void sig_handler(int sig) { \n  signal_flag = 1; \n} \n \nvoid install_signal_handler() { \n  if (SIG_ERR == std::signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler)) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \n \n// Called periodically to poll the signal flag. \nvoid poll_signal_flag() { \n  if (signal_flag == 1) { \n    signal_flag = 0; \n    try { \n      g(); \n    } catch(...) { \n      // Handle error \n    } \n  } \n} \nMiscellaneous (MSC) - MSC54-CPP.

Obey the one-definition rule \nNontrivial C++ programs are generally divided into multiple translation units that are later linked \ntogether to form an executable. To support such a model, C++ restricts named object definitions \nto ensure that linking will behave deterministically by requiring a single definition for an object \nacross all translation units. This model is called the one-definition rule (ODR), which is defined \nby the C++ Standard, [basic.def.odr] in paragraph 4 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014]: \nEvery program shall contain exactly one definition of every non-inline function or variable \nthat is odr-used in that program; no diagnostic required. The definition can appear \nexplicitly in the program, it can be found in the standard or a user-defined library, or \n(when appropriate) it is implicitly defined. An inline function shall be defined in every \ntranslation unit in which it is odr-used. \nThe most common approach to multitranslation unit compilation involves declarations residing in \na header file that is subsequently made available to a source file via #include. These \ndeclarations are often also definitions, such as class and function template definitions. This \napproach is allowed by an exception defined in paragraph 6, which, in part, states the following: \nThere can be more than one definition of a class type, enumeration type, inline function \nwith external linkage, class template, non-static function template, static data member of \na class template, member function of a class template, or template specialization for \nwhich some template parameters are not specified in a program provided that each \ndefinition appears in a different translation unit, and provided the definitions satisfy the \nfollowing requirements. Given such an entity named D defined in more than one \ntranslation unit.... \nIf the definitions of D satisfy all these requirements, then the program shall behave as if \nthere were a single definition of D. If the definitions of D do not satisfy these \nrequirements, then the behavior is undefined. \nThe requirements specified by paragraph 6 essentially state that that two definitions must be \nidentical (not simply equivalent). Consequently, a definition introduced in two separate translation \nunits by an #include directive generally will not violate the ODR because the definitions are \nidentical in both translation units. \nHowever, it is possible to violate the ODR of a definition introduced via #include using block \nlanguage linkage specifications, vendor-specific language extensions, and so on. A more likely \nscenario for ODR violations is that accidental definitions of differing objects will exist in different \ntranslation units. \nDo not violate the one-definition rule; violations result in undefined behavior. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

Although the two definitions are functionally equivalent (they both \ndefine a class named S with a single, public, nonstatic data member int a), they are not defined \nusing the same sequence of tokens.

However, one of the translation units uses an implementation-defined #pragma that \nis supported by Microsoft Visual Studio to specify structure field alignment requirements. \nConsequently, the two class definitions may have differing layouts in each translation unit, which \nis a violation of the ODR. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

However, each translation unit has a \nunique instance of n, resulting in a violation of the ODR. \nconst int n = 42; \n \nint g(const int &lhs, const int &rhs); \n  \ninline int f(int k) { \n  return g(k, n); \n} \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

This solution is compliant but it is not ideal. It may not be possible (or \ndesirable) to modify the signature of g(), such as if g() represented std::max() from \n<algorithm>.

As shown in “Support for Whole-Program Analysis and the Verification of the \nOne-Definition Rule in C++” [Quinlan 2006], failing to enforce the ODR enables a virtual \nfunction pointer attack known as the VPTR exploit. In this exploit, an object’s virtual function \ntable is corrupted so that calling a virtual function on the object results in malicious code being \nexecuted. See the paper by Quinlan and colleagues for more details. However, note that to \nintroduce the malicious class, the attacker must have access to the system building the code. \nRule \nSeverity \nLikelihood \nRemediation Cost \nPriority \nLevel \nDCL60-CPP \nHigh \nUnlikely \nHigh \nP3 \nL3 \n2.11.10 \nBibliography \n[ISO/IEC 14882-2014] \nSubclause 3.2, “One Definition Rule” \n[Quinlan 2006] \n \nExpressions (EXP) - EXP50-CPP.

Avoid cycles during initialization of static objects \nThe C++ Standard, [stmt.dcl], paragraph 4 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the following: \nThe zero-initialization (8.5) of all block-scope variables with static storage duration \n(3.7.1) or thread storage duration (3.7.2) is performed before any other initialization \ntakes place. Constant initialization (3.6.2) of a block-scope entity with static storage \nduration, if applicable, is performed before its block is first entered. An implementation is \npermitted to perform early initialization of other block-scope variables with static or \nthread storage duration under the same conditions that an implementation is permitted \nto statically initialize a variable with static or thread storage duration in namespace \nscope (3.6.2). Otherwise such a variable is initialized the first time control passes \nthrough its declaration; such a variable is considered initialized upon the completion of \nits initialization. If the initialization exits by throwing an exception, the initialization is not \ncomplete, so it will be tried again the next time control enters the declaration. If control \nenters the declaration concurrently while the variable is being initialized, the concurrent \nexecution shall wait for completion of the initialization. If control re-enters the declaration \nrecursively while the variable is being initialized, the behavior is undefined. \nDo not reenter a function during the initialization of a static variable declaration. If a function is \nreentered during the constant initialization of a static object inside that function, the behavior of \nthe program is undefined. Infinite recursion is not required to trigger undefined behavior, the \nfunction need only recur once as part of the initialization. Due to thread-safe initialization of \nvariables, a single, recursive call will often result in a deadlock due to locking a non-recursive \nsynchronization primitive. \nAdditionally, the C++ Standard, [basic.start.init], paragraph 2, in part, states the following: \nDynamic initialization of a non-local variable with static storage duration is either ordered \nor unordered. Definitions of explicitly specialized class template static data members \nhave ordered initialization. Other class template static data members (i.e., implicitly or \nexplicitly instantiated specializations) have unordered initialization. Other non-local \nvariables with static storage duration have ordered initialization. Variables with ordered \ninitialization defined within a single translation unit shall be initialized in the order of their \ndefinitions in the translation unit. If a program starts a thread, the subsequent \ninitialization of a variable is unsequenced with respect to the initialization of a variable \ndefined in a different translation unit. Otherwise, the initialization of a variable is \nindeterminately sequenced with respect to the initialization of a variable defined in a \ndifferent translation unit. If a program starts a thread, the subsequent unordered \ninitialization of a variable is unsequenced with respect to every other dynamic \ninitialization. Otherwise, the unordered initialization of a variable is indeterminately \nsequenced with respect to every other dynamic initialization. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL56-CPP.

This is often referred to \nas the “static initialization order fiasco,” and the resulting behavior is unspecified. \n// file.h \n#ifndef FILE_H \n#define FILE_H \n \nclass Car { \n  int numWheels; \n \npublic: \n  Car() : numWheels(4) {} \n  explicit Car(int numWheels) : numWheels(numWheels) {} \n \n  int get_num_wheels() const { return numWheels; } \n}; \n#endif // FILE_H \n \n// file1.cpp \n#include "file.h" \n#include <iostream> \n \nextern Car c; \nint numWheels = c.get_num_wheels(); \n \nint main() { \n  std::cout << numWheels << std::endl; \n} \n \n// file2.cpp \n#include "file.h" \n \nCar get_default_car() { return Car(6); } \nCar c = get_default_car(); \n2.7.3.1 Implementation Details \nThe value printed to the standard output stream will often rely on the order in which the \ntranslation units are linked.

Ensure your random number generator is properly \nseeded \nA pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) is a deterministic algorithm capable of generating \nsequences of numbers that approximate the properties of random numbers. Each sequence is \ncompletely determined by the initial state of the PRNG and the algorithm for changing the state. \nMost PRNGs make it possible to set the initial state, also called the seed state. Setting the initial \nstate is called seeding the PRNG. \nCalling a PRNG in the same initial state, either without seeding it explicitly or by seeding it with a \nconstant value, results in generating the same sequence of random numbers in different runs of the \nprogram. Consider a PRNG function that is seeded with some initial seed value and is \nconsecutively called to produce a sequence of random numbers. If the PRNG is subsequently \nseeded with the same initial seed value, then it will generate the same sequence. \nConsequently, after the first run of an improperly seeded PRNG, an attacker can predict the \nsequence of random numbers that will be generated in the future runs. Improperly seeding or \nfailing to seed the PRNG can lead to vulnerabilities, especially in security protocols. \nThe solution is to ensure that a PRNG is always properly seeded with an initial seed value that \nwill not be predictable or controllable by an attacker. A properly seeded PRNG will generate a \ndifferent sequence of random numbers each time it is run. \nNot all random number generators can be seeded. True random number generators that rely on \nhardware to produce completely unpredictable results do not need to be and cannot be seeded. \nSome high-quality PRNGs, such as the /dev/random device on some UNIX systems, also \ncannot be seeded. This rule applies only to algorithmic PRNGs that can be seeded. \n12.2.1 Noncompliant Code Example \nThis noncompliant code example generates a sequence of 10 pseudorandom numbers using the \nMersenne Twister engine.

Prevent data races when accessing bit-fields from \nmultiple threads \nWhen accessing a bit-field, a thread may inadvertently access a separate bit-field in adjacent \nmemory. This is because compilers are required to store multiple adjacent bit-fields in one storage \nunit whenever they fit. Consequently, data races may exist not just on a bit-field accessed by \nmultiple threads but also on other bit-fields sharing the same byte or word. The problem is \ndifficult to diagnose because it may not be obvious that the same memory location is being \nmodified by multiple threads. \nOne approach for preventing data races in concurrent programming is to use a mutex. When \nproperly observed by all threads, a mutex can provide safe and secure access to a shared object. \nHowever, mutexes provide no guarantees with regard to other objects that might be accessed \nwhen the mutex is not controlled by the accessing thread. Unfortunately, there is no portable way \nto determine which adjacent bit-fields may be stored along with the desired bit-field. \nAnother approach is to insert a non-bit-field member between any two bit-fields to ensure that \neach bit-field is the only one accessed within its storage unit. This technique effectively \nguarantees that no two bit-fields are accessed simultaneously. \n11.3.1 Noncompliant Code Example (bit-field) \nAdjacent bit-fields may be stored in a single memory location. Consequently, modifying adjacent \nbit-fields in different threads is undefined behavior, as shown in this noncompliant code example. \nstruct MultiThreadedFlags { \n  unsigned int flag1 : 2; \n  unsigned int flag2 : 2; \n}; \n \nMultiThreadedFlags flags; \n \nvoid thread1() { \n  flags.flag1 = 1; \n} \n \nvoid thread2() { \n  flags.flag2 = 2; \n} \nConcurrency (CON) - CON52-CPP.

Because the members occupy different bytes in memory, no concurrency protection \nis required. \nstruct MultiThreadedFlags { \n  unsigned char flag1; \n  unsigned char flag2; \n}; \n  \nMultiThreadedFlags flags; \n  \nvoid thread1() { \n  flags.flag1 = 1; \n} \n \nvoid thread2() { \n  flags.flag2 = 2; \n} \nUnlike earlier versions of the standard, C++11 and later explicitly define a memory location and \nprovide the following note in [intro.memory] paragraph 4 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014]: \n[Note: Thus a bit-field and an adjacent non-bit-field are in separate memory locations, \nand therefore can be concurrently updated by two threads of execution without \ninterference.  The same applies to two bit-fields, if one is declared inside a nested struct \ndeclaration and the other is not, or if the two are separated by a zero-length bit-field \ndeclaration, or if they are separated by a non-bit-field declaration.  It is not safe to \nconcurrently update two bit-fields in the same struct if all fields between them are also \nbit-fields of non-zero width.  – end note ] \nIt is almost certain that flag1 and flag2 are stored in the same word. Using a compiler that \nconforms to earlier versions of the standard, if both assignments occur on a thread-scheduling \ninterleaving that ends with both stores occurring after one another, it is possible that only one of \nthe flags will be set as intended, and the other flag will contain its previous value because both \nmembers are represented by the same word, which is the smallest unit the processor can work on. \nBefore the changes made to the C++ Standard for C++11, there were no guarantees that these \nflags could be modified concurrently. \nConcurrency (CON) - CON52-CPP.

Avoid deadlock by locking in a predefined order \nMutexes are used to prevent multiple threads from causing a data race by accessing the same \nshared resource at the same time. Sometimes, when locking mutexes, multiple threads hold each \nother’s lock, and the program consequently deadlocks. Four conditions are required for deadlock \nto occur: \n• \nmutual exclusion (At least one nonshareable resource must be held.),  \n• \nhold and wait (A thread must hold a resource while awaiting availability of another \nresource.),  \n• \nno preemption (Resources cannot be taken away from a thread while they are in-use.), and  \n• \ncircular wait (A thread must await a resource held by another thread which is, in turn, \nawaiting a resource held by the first thread.). \nDeadlock needs all four conditions, so preventing deadlock requires preventing any one of the \nfour conditions. One simple solution is to lock the mutexes in a predefined order, which prevents \ncircular wait. \n11.4.1 Noncompliant Code Example \nThe behavior of this noncompliant code example depends on the runtime environment and the \nplatform’s scheduler.

Do not depend on the order of evaluation for side \neffects \nIn C++, modifying an object, calling a library I/O function, accessing a volatile-qualified \nvalue, or calling a function that performs one of these actions are ways to modify the state of the \nexecution environment. These actions are called side effects. All relationships between value \ncomputations and side effects can be described in terms of sequencing of their evaluations. The \nC++ Standard, [intro.execution], paragraph 13 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], establishes three \nsequencing terms: \nSequenced before is an asymmetric, transitive, pair-wise relation between evaluations \nexecuted by a single thread, which induces a partial order among those evaluations. \nGiven any two evaluations A and B, if A is sequenced before B, then the execution of A \nshall precede the execution of B. If A is not sequenced before B and B is not sequenced \nbefore A, then A and B are unsequenced. [Note: The execution of unsequenced \nevaluations can overlap. — end note] Evaluations A and B are indeterminately \nsequenced when either A is sequenced before B or B is sequenced before A, but it is \nunspecified which. [Note: Indeterminately sequenced evaluations cannot overlap, but \neither could be executed first. — end note] \nParagraph 15 further states (nonnormative text removed for brevity) the following: \nExcept where noted, evaluations of operands of individual operators and of \nsubexpressions of individual expressions are unsequenced. ... The value computations \nof the operands of an operator are sequenced before the value computation of the result \nof the operator. If a side effect on a scalar object is unsequenced relative to either \nanother side effect on the same scalar object or a value computation using the value of \nthe same scalar object, and they are not potentially concurrent, the behavior is \nundefined. ... When calling a function (whether or not the function is inline), every value \ncomputation and side effect associated with any argument expression, or with the postfix \nexpression designating the called function, is sequenced before execution of every \nexpression or statement in the body of the called function. ... Every evaluation in the \ncalling function (including other function calls) that is not otherwise specifically \nsequenced before or after the execution of the body of the called function is \nindeterminately sequenced with respect to the execution of the called function. Several \ncontexts in C++ cause evaluation of a function call, even though no corresponding \nfunction call syntax appears in the translation unit. ...

Avoid cycles during initialization of static objects \nThe C++ Standard, [stmt.dcl], paragraph 4 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the following: \nThe zero-initialization (8.5) of all block-scope variables with static storage duration \n(3.7.1) or thread storage duration (3.7.2) is performed before any other initialization \ntakes place. Constant initialization (3.6.2) of a block-scope entity with static storage \nduration, if applicable, is performed before its block is first entered. An implementation is \npermitted to perform early initialization of other block-scope variables with static or \nthread storage duration under the same conditions that an implementation is permitted \nto statically initialize a variable with static or thread storage duration in namespace \nscope (3.6.2). Otherwise such a variable is initialized the first time control passes \nthrough its declaration; such a variable is considered initialized upon the completion of \nits initialization. If the initialization exits by throwing an exception, the initialization is not \ncomplete, so it will be tried again the next time control enters the declaration. If control \nenters the declaration concurrently while the variable is being initialized, the concurrent \nexecution shall wait for completion of the initialization. If control re-enters the declaration \nrecursively while the variable is being initialized, the behavior is undefined. \nDo not reenter a function during the initialization of a static variable declaration. If a function is \nreentered during the constant initialization of a static object inside that function, the behavior of \nthe program is undefined. Infinite recursion is not required to trigger undefined behavior, the \nfunction need only recur once as part of the initialization. Due to thread-safe initialization of \nvariables, a single, recursive call will often result in a deadlock due to locking a non-recursive \nsynchronization primitive. \nAdditionally, the C++ Standard, [basic.start.init], paragraph 2, in part, states the following: \nDynamic initialization of a non-local variable with static storage duration is either ordered \nor unordered. Definitions of explicitly specialized class template static data members \nhave ordered initialization. Other class template static data members (i.e., implicitly or \nexplicitly instantiated specializations) have unordered initialization. Other non-local \nvariables with static storage duration have ordered initialization. Variables with ordered \ninitialization defined within a single translation unit shall be initialized in the order of their \ndefinitions in the translation unit. If a program starts a thread, the subsequent \ninitialization of a variable is unsequenced with respect to the initialization of a variable \ndefined in a different translation unit. Otherwise, the initialization of a variable is \nindeterminately sequenced with respect to the initialization of a variable defined in a \ndifferent translation unit. If a program starts a thread, the subsequent unordered \ninitialization of a variable is unsequenced with respect to every other dynamic \ninitialization. Otherwise, the unordered initialization of a variable is indeterminately \nsequenced with respect to every other dynamic initialization. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL56-CPP.

A signal handler must be a plain old function \nThe C++ Standard, [support.runtime], paragraph 10 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the following: \nThe common subset of the C and C++ languages consists of all declarations, definitions, \nand expressions that may appear in a well formed C++ program and also in a \nconforming C program. A POF (“plain old function”) is a function that uses only features \nfrom this common subset, and that does not directly or indirectly use any function that is \nnot a POF, except that it may use plain lock-free atomic operations. A plain lock-free \natomic operation is an invocation of a function f from Clause 29, such that f is not a \nmember function, and either f is the function atomic_is_lock_free, or for every \natomic argument A passed to f, atomic_is_lock_free(A) yields true. All signal \nhandlers shall have C linkage. The behavior of any function other than a POF used as a \nsignal handler in a C++ program is implementation-defined.228 \nFootnote 228 states the following: \nIn particular, a signal handler using exception handling is very likely to have problems. \nAlso, invoking std::exit may cause destruction of objects, including those of the \nstandard library implementation, which, in general, yields undefined behavior in a signal \nhandler. \nIf your signal handler is not a plain old function, then the behavior of a call to it in response to a \nsignal is implementation-defined, at best, and is likely to result in undefined behavior. All signal \nhandlers must meet the definition of a plain old function. In addition to the restrictions placed on \nsignal handlers in a C program, this definition also prohibits the use of features that exist in C++ \nbut not in C (such as non-POD [non–plain old data] objects and exceptions). This includes \nindirect use of such features through function calls.  \n12.5.1 Noncompliant Code Example \nIn this noncompliant code example, the signal handler is declared as a static function. \nHowever, since all signal handler functions must have C language linkage, and C++ is the default \nlanguage linkage for functions in C++, calling the signal handler results in undefined behavior. \n#include <csignal> \n \nstatic void sig_handler(int sig) { \n  // Implementation details elided. \n} \n \nvoid install_signal_handler() { \n  if (SIG_ERR == std::signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler)) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \nMiscellaneous (MSC) - MSC54-CPP.

As a \nconsequence of declaring the signal handler with C language linkage, the signal handler will have \nexternal linkage rather than internal linkage. \n#include <csignal> \n  \nextern "C" void sig_handler(int sig) { \n  // Implementation details elided. \n} \n \nvoid install_signal_handler() { \n  if (SIG_ERR == std::signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler)) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \n12.5.3 Noncompliant Code Example \nIn this noncompliant code example, a signal handler calls a function that allows exceptions, and it \nattempts to handle any exceptions thrown. Because exceptions are not part of the common subset \nof C and C++ features, this example results in implementation-defined behavior. However, it is \nunlikely that the implementation’s behavior will be suitable. For instance, on a stack-based \narchitecture where a signal is generated asynchronously (instead of as a result of a call to \nstd:abort() or std::raise()), it is possible that the stack frame is not properly \ninitialized, causing stack tracing to be unreliable and preventing the exception from being caught \nproperly. \n#include <csignal> \n \nstatic void g() noexcept(false); \n \nextern "C" void sig_handler(int sig) { \n  try { \n    g(); \n  } catch (...) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \n \nvoid install_signal_handler() { \n  if (SIG_ERR == std::signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler)) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \nMiscellaneous (MSC) - MSC54-CPP.

Even if g() were implemented such that it handled all exceptions and was \nmarked noexcept(true), it would still be noncompliant to call g()from a signal handler \nbecause g() would still use a feature that is not a part of the common subset of C and C++ \nfeatures allowed by a signal handler. Therefore, this compliant solution removes the call to g() \nfrom the signal handler and instead polls a variable of type volatile sig_atomic_t \nperiodically; if the variable is set to 1 in the signal handler, then g() is called to respond to the \nsignal. \n#include <csignal> \n \nvolatile sig_atomic_t signal_flag = 0; \nstatic void g() noexcept(false); \n \nextern "C" void sig_handler(int sig) { \n  signal_flag = 1; \n} \n \nvoid install_signal_handler() { \n  if (SIG_ERR == std::signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler)) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \n \n// Called periodically to poll the signal flag. \nvoid poll_signal_flag() { \n  if (signal_flag == 1) { \n    signal_flag = 0; \n    try { \n      g(); \n    } catch(...) { \n      // Handle error \n    } \n  } \n} \nMiscellaneous (MSC) - MSC54-CPP.

Obey the one-definition rule \nNontrivial C++ programs are generally divided into multiple translation units that are later linked \ntogether to form an executable. To support such a model, C++ restricts named object definitions \nto ensure that linking will behave deterministically by requiring a single definition for an object \nacross all translation units. This model is called the one-definition rule (ODR), which is defined \nby the C++ Standard, [basic.def.odr] in paragraph 4 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014]: \nEvery program shall contain exactly one definition of every non-inline function or variable \nthat is odr-used in that program; no diagnostic required. The definition can appear \nexplicitly in the program, it can be found in the standard or a user-defined library, or \n(when appropriate) it is implicitly defined. An inline function shall be defined in every \ntranslation unit in which it is odr-used. \nThe most common approach to multitranslation unit compilation involves declarations residing in \na header file that is subsequently made available to a source file via #include. These \ndeclarations are often also definitions, such as class and function template definitions. This \napproach is allowed by an exception defined in paragraph 6, which, in part, states the following: \nThere can be more than one definition of a class type, enumeration type, inline function \nwith external linkage, class template, non-static function template, static data member of \na class template, member function of a class template, or template specialization for \nwhich some template parameters are not specified in a program provided that each \ndefinition appears in a different translation unit, and provided the definitions satisfy the \nfollowing requirements. Given such an entity named D defined in more than one \ntranslation unit.... \nIf the definitions of D satisfy all these requirements, then the program shall behave as if \nthere were a single definition of D. If the definitions of D do not satisfy these \nrequirements, then the behavior is undefined. \nThe requirements specified by paragraph 6 essentially state that that two definitions must be \nidentical (not simply equivalent). Consequently, a definition introduced in two separate translation \nunits by an #include directive generally will not violate the ODR because the definitions are \nidentical in both translation units. \nHowever, it is possible to violate the ODR of a definition introduced via #include using block \nlanguage linkage specifications, vendor-specific language extensions, and so on. A more likely \nscenario for ODR violations is that accidental definitions of differing objects will exist in different \ntranslation units. \nDo not violate the one-definition rule; violations result in undefined behavior. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

Although the two definitions are functionally equivalent (they both \ndefine a class named S with a single, public, nonstatic data member int a), they are not defined \nusing the same sequence of tokens.

If the programmer intends for the same \nclass definition to be visible in both translation units because of common usage, the solution is to \nuse a header file to introduce the object into both translation units, as shown in this compliant \nsolution. \n// S.h \nstruct S { \n  int a; \n}; \n \n// a.cpp \n#include "S.h" \n  \n// b.cpp \n#include "S.h" \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

However, one of the translation units uses an implementation-defined #pragma that \nis supported by Microsoft Visual Studio to specify structure field alignment requirements. \nConsequently, the two class definitions may have differing layouts in each translation unit, which \nis a violation of the ODR. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

Consequently, when init_s() initializes the data members of s, it may result in a \nbuffer overrun. \nFor more information on the behavior of #pragma pack, see the vendor documentation for \nyour implementation, such as Microsoft Visual Studio or GCC. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

Because f() is declared as an inline function, the \ndefinition of f() must be identical in all translation units. However, each translation unit has a \nunique instance of n, resulting in a violation of the ODR. \nconst int n = 42; \n \nint g(const int &lhs, const int &rhs); \n  \ninline int f(int k) { \n  return g(k, n); \n} \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

This solution is compliant but it is not ideal. It may not be possible (or \ndesirable) to modify the signature of g(), such as if g() represented std::max() from \n<algorithm>. Also, because of the differing linkage used by n and f(), accidental violations \nof the ODR are still likely if the definition of f() is modified to odr-use n. \nconst int n = 42; \n \nint g(int lhs, int rhs); \n  \ninline int f(int k) { \n  return g(k, n); \n} \n2.11.8 Compliant Solution \nIn this compliant solution, the constant object n is replaced with an enumerator of the same name. \nNamed enumerations defined at namespace scope have the same linkage as the namespace they \nare contained in. The global namespace has external linkage, so the definition of the named \nenumeration and its contained enumerators also have external linkage. Although less aesthetically \npleasing, this compliant solution does not suffer from the same maintenance burdens of the \nprevious code because n and f() have the same linkage. \nenum Constants { \n  N = 42 \n}; \n \nint g(const int &lhs, const int &rhs); \n  \ninline int f(int k) { \n  return g(k, N); \n} \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

As shown in “Support for Whole-Program Analysis and the Verification of the \nOne-Definition Rule in C++” [Quinlan 2006], failing to enforce the ODR enables a virtual \nfunction pointer attack known as the VPTR exploit. In this exploit, an object’s virtual function \ntable is corrupted so that calling a virtual function on the object results in malicious code being \nexecuted. See the paper by Quinlan and colleagues for more details.

Ensure your random number generator is properly \nseeded \nA pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) is a deterministic algorithm capable of generating \nsequences of numbers that approximate the properties of random numbers. Each sequence is \ncompletely determined by the initial state of the PRNG and the algorithm for changing the state. \nMost PRNGs make it possible to set the initial state, also called the seed state. Setting the initial \nstate is called seeding the PRNG. \nCalling a PRNG in the same initial state, either without seeding it explicitly or by seeding it with a \nconstant value, results in generating the same sequence of random numbers in different runs of the \nprogram. Consider a PRNG function that is seeded with some initial seed value and is \nconsecutively called to produce a sequence of random numbers. If the PRNG is subsequently \nseeded with the same initial seed value, then it will generate the same sequence. \nConsequently, after the first run of an improperly seeded PRNG, an attacker can predict the \nsequence of random numbers that will be generated in the future runs. Improperly seeding or \nfailing to seed the PRNG can lead to vulnerabilities, especially in security protocols. \nThe solution is to ensure that a PRNG is always properly seeded with an initial seed value that \nwill not be predictable or controllable by an attacker. A properly seeded PRNG will generate a \ndifferent sequence of random numbers each time it is run. \nNot all random number generators can be seeded. True random number generators that rely on \nhardware to produce completely unpredictable results do not need to be and cannot be seeded. \nSome high-quality PRNGs, such as the /dev/random device on some UNIX systems, also \ncannot be seeded. This rule applies only to algorithmic PRNGs that can be seeded. \n12.2.1 Noncompliant Code Example \nThis noncompliant code example generates a sequence of 10 pseudorandom numbers using the \nMersenne Twister engine.

Avoid deadlock by locking in a predefined order \nMutexes are used to prevent multiple threads from causing a data race by accessing the same \nshared resource at the same time. Sometimes, when locking mutexes, multiple threads hold each \nother’s lock, and the program consequently deadlocks. Four conditions are required for deadlock \nto occur: \n• \nmutual exclusion (At least one nonshareable resource must be held.),  \n• \nhold and wait (A thread must hold a resource while awaiting availability of another \nresource.),  \n• \nno preemption (Resources cannot be taken away from a thread while they are in-use.), and  \n• \ncircular wait (A thread must await a resource held by another thread which is, in turn, \nawaiting a resource held by the first thread.). \nDeadlock needs all four conditions, so preventing deadlock requires preventing any one of the \nfour conditions. One simple solution is to lock the mutexes in a predefined order, which prevents \ncircular wait. \n11.4.1 Noncompliant Code Example \nThe behavior of this noncompliant code example depends on the runtime environment and the \nplatform’s scheduler.

Do not depend on the order of evaluation for side \neffects \nIn C++, modifying an object, calling a library I/O function, accessing a volatile-qualified \nvalue, or calling a function that performs one of these actions are ways to modify the state of the \nexecution environment. These actions are called side effects. All relationships between value \ncomputations and side effects can be described in terms of sequencing of their evaluations. The \nC++ Standard, [intro.execution], paragraph 13 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], establishes three \nsequencing terms: \nSequenced before is an asymmetric, transitive, pair-wise relation between evaluations \nexecuted by a single thread, which induces a partial order among those evaluations. \nGiven any two evaluations A and B, if A is sequenced before B, then the execution of A \nshall precede the execution of B. If A is not sequenced before B and B is not sequenced \nbefore A, then A and B are unsequenced. [Note: The execution of unsequenced \nevaluations can overlap. — end note] Evaluations A and B are indeterminately \nsequenced when either A is sequenced before B or B is sequenced before A, but it is \nunspecified which. [Note: Indeterminately sequenced evaluations cannot overlap, but \neither could be executed first. — end note] \nParagraph 15 further states (nonnormative text removed for brevity) the following: \nExcept where noted, evaluations of operands of individual operators and of \nsubexpressions of individual expressions are unsequenced. ... The value computations \nof the operands of an operator are sequenced before the value computation of the result \nof the operator. If a side effect on a scalar object is unsequenced relative to either \nanother side effect on the same scalar object or a value computation using the value of \nthe same scalar object, and they are not potentially concurrent, the behavior is \nundefined. ... When calling a function (whether or not the function is inline), every value \ncomputation and side effect associated with any argument expression, or with the postfix \nexpression designating the called function, is sequenced before execution of every \nexpression or statement in the body of the called function. ... Every evaluation in the \ncalling function (including other function calls) that is not otherwise specifically \nsequenced before or after the execution of the body of the called function is \nindeterminately sequenced with respect to the execution of the called function. Several \ncontexts in C++ cause evaluation of a function call, even though no corresponding \nfunction call syntax appears in the translation unit. ... The sequencing constraints on the \nexecution of the called function (as described above) are features of the function calls as \nevaluated, whatever the syntax of the expression that calls the function might be. \nExpressions (EXP) - EXP50-CPP.

([expr.post.incr], paragraph 1) \n• \nIn logical && expressions, if the second expression is evaluated, every value computation and \nside effect associated with the first expression is sequenced before every value computation \nand side effect associated with the second expression. ([expr.log.and], paragraph 2) \n• \nIn logical || expressions, if the second expression is evaluated, every value computation and \nside effect associated with the first expression is sequenced before every value computation \nand side effect associated with the second expression. ([expr.log.or], paragraph 2) \n• \nIn conditional ?: expressions, every value computation and side effect associated with the \nfirst expression is sequenced before every value computation and side effect associated with \nthe second or third expression (whichever is evaluated). ([expr.cond], paragraph 1) \n• \nIn assignment expressions (including compound assignments), the assignment is sequenced \nafter the value computations of left and right operands and before the value computation of \nthe assignment expression. ([expr.ass], paragraph 1) \n• \nIn comma , expressions, every value computation and side effect associated with the left \nexpression is sequenced before every value computation and side effect associated with the \nright expression. ([expr.comma], paragraph 1) \n• \nWhen evaluating initializer lists, the value computation and side effect associated with each \ninitializer-clause is sequenced before every value computation and side effect associated with \na subsequent initializer-clause. ([dcl.init.list], paragraph 4) \n• \nWhen a signal handler is executed as a result of a call to std::raise(), the execution of \nthe handler is sequenced after the invocation of std::raise() and before its return. \n([intro.execution], paragraph 6) \n• \nThe completions of the destructors for all initialized objects with thread storage duration \nwithin a thread are sequenced before the initiation of the destructors of any object with static \nstorage duration. ([basic.start.term], paragraph 1) \n• \nIn a new-expression, initialization of an allocated object is sequenced before the value \ncomputation of the new-expression. ([expr.new], paragraph 18) \n• \nWhen a default constructor is called to initialize an element of an array and the constructor \nhas at least one default argument, the destruction of every temporary created in a default \nargument is sequenced before the construction of the next array element, if any. \n([class.temporary], paragraph 4) \n• \nThe destruction of a temporary whose lifetime is not extended by being bound to a reference \nis sequenced before the destruction of every temporary that is constructed earlier in the same \nfull-expression.

Avoid cycles during initialization of static objects \nThe C++ Standard, [stmt.dcl], paragraph 4 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the following: \nThe zero-initialization (8.5) of all block-scope variables with static storage duration \n(3.7.1) or thread storage duration (3.7.2) is performed before any other initialization \ntakes place. Constant initialization (3.6.2) of a block-scope entity with static storage \nduration, if applicable, is performed before its block is first entered. An implementation is \npermitted to perform early initialization of other block-scope variables with static or \nthread storage duration under the same conditions that an implementation is permitted \nto statically initialize a variable with static or thread storage duration in namespace \nscope (3.6.2). Otherwise such a variable is initialized the first time control passes \nthrough its declaration; such a variable is considered initialized upon the completion of \nits initialization. If the initialization exits by throwing an exception, the initialization is not \ncomplete, so it will be tried again the next time control enters the declaration. If control \nenters the declaration concurrently while the variable is being initialized, the concurrent \nexecution shall wait for completion of the initialization. If control re-enters the declaration \nrecursively while the variable is being initialized, the behavior is undefined. \nDo not reenter a function during the initialization of a static variable declaration. If a function is \nreentered during the constant initialization of a static object inside that function, the behavior of \nthe program is undefined. Infinite recursion is not required to trigger undefined behavior, the \nfunction need only recur once as part of the initialization. Due to thread-safe initialization of \nvariables, a single, recursive call will often result in a deadlock due to locking a non-recursive \nsynchronization primitive. \nAdditionally, the C++ Standard, [basic.start.init], paragraph 2, in part, states the following: \nDynamic initialization of a non-local variable with static storage duration is either ordered \nor unordered. Definitions of explicitly specialized class template static data members \nhave ordered initialization. Other class template static data members (i.e., implicitly or \nexplicitly instantiated specializations) have unordered initialization. Other non-local \nvariables with static storage duration have ordered initialization. Variables with ordered \ninitialization defined within a single translation unit shall be initialized in the order of their \ndefinitions in the translation unit. If a program starts a thread, the subsequent \ninitialization of a variable is unsequenced with respect to the initialization of a variable \ndefined in a different translation unit. Otherwise, the initialization of a variable is \nindeterminately sequenced with respect to the initialization of a variable defined in a \ndifferent translation unit. If a program starts a thread, the subsequent unordered \ninitialization of a variable is unsequenced with respect to every other dynamic \ninitialization.

A signal handler must be a plain old function \nThe C++ Standard, [support.runtime], paragraph 10 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the following: \nThe common subset of the C and C++ languages consists of all declarations, definitions, \nand expressions that may appear in a well formed C++ program and also in a \nconforming C program. A POF (“plain old function”) is a function that uses only features \nfrom this common subset, and that does not directly or indirectly use any function that is \nnot a POF, except that it may use plain lock-free atomic operations. A plain lock-free \natomic operation is an invocation of a function f from Clause 29, such that f is not a \nmember function, and either f is the function atomic_is_lock_free, or for every \natomic argument A passed to f, atomic_is_lock_free(A) yields true. All signal \nhandlers shall have C linkage. The behavior of any function other than a POF used as a \nsignal handler in a C++ program is implementation-defined.228 \nFootnote 228 states the following: \nIn particular, a signal handler using exception handling is very likely to have problems. \nAlso, invoking std::exit may cause destruction of objects, including those of the \nstandard library implementation, which, in general, yields undefined behavior in a signal \nhandler. \nIf your signal handler is not a plain old function, then the behavior of a call to it in response to a \nsignal is implementation-defined, at best, and is likely to result in undefined behavior. All signal \nhandlers must meet the definition of a plain old function. In addition to the restrictions placed on \nsignal handlers in a C program, this definition also prohibits the use of features that exist in C++ \nbut not in C (such as non-POD [non–plain old data] objects and exceptions). This includes \nindirect use of such features through function calls.  \n12.5.1 Noncompliant Code Example \nIn this noncompliant code example, the signal handler is declared as a static function. \nHowever, since all signal handler functions must have C language linkage, and C++ is the default \nlanguage linkage for functions in C++, calling the signal handler results in undefined behavior. \n#include <csignal> \n \nstatic void sig_handler(int sig) { \n  // Implementation details elided. \n} \n \nvoid install_signal_handler() { \n  if (SIG_ERR == std::signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler)) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \nMiscellaneous (MSC) - MSC54-CPP.

As a \nconsequence of declaring the signal handler with C language linkage, the signal handler will have \nexternal linkage rather than internal linkage. \n#include <csignal> \n  \nextern "C" void sig_handler(int sig) { \n  // Implementation details elided. \n} \n \nvoid install_signal_handler() { \n  if (SIG_ERR == std::signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler)) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \n12.5.3 Noncompliant Code Example \nIn this noncompliant code example, a signal handler calls a function that allows exceptions, and it \nattempts to handle any exceptions thrown. Because exceptions are not part of the common subset \nof C and C++ features, this example results in implementation-defined behavior. However, it is \nunlikely that the implementation’s behavior will be suitable. For instance, on a stack-based \narchitecture where a signal is generated asynchronously (instead of as a result of a call to \nstd:abort() or std::raise()), it is possible that the stack frame is not properly \ninitialized, causing stack tracing to be unreliable and preventing the exception from being caught \nproperly. \n#include <csignal> \n \nstatic void g() noexcept(false); \n \nextern "C" void sig_handler(int sig) { \n  try { \n    g(); \n  } catch (...) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \n \nvoid install_signal_handler() { \n  if (SIG_ERR == std::signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler)) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \nMiscellaneous (MSC) - MSC54-CPP.

Even if g() were implemented such that it handled all exceptions and was \nmarked noexcept(true), it would still be noncompliant to call g()from a signal handler \nbecause g() would still use a feature that is not a part of the common subset of C and C++ \nfeatures allowed by a signal handler. Therefore, this compliant solution removes the call to g() \nfrom the signal handler and instead polls a variable of type volatile sig_atomic_t \nperiodically; if the variable is set to 1 in the signal handler, then g() is called to respond to the \nsignal. \n#include <csignal> \n \nvolatile sig_atomic_t signal_flag = 0; \nstatic void g() noexcept(false); \n \nextern "C" void sig_handler(int sig) { \n  signal_flag = 1; \n} \n \nvoid install_signal_handler() { \n  if (SIG_ERR == std::signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler)) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \n \n// Called periodically to poll the signal flag. \nvoid poll_signal_flag() { \n  if (signal_flag == 1) { \n    signal_flag = 0; \n    try { \n      g(); \n    } catch(...) { \n      // Handle error \n    } \n  } \n} \nMiscellaneous (MSC) - MSC54-CPP.

Obey the one-definition rule \nNontrivial C++ programs are generally divided into multiple translation units that are later linked \ntogether to form an executable. To support such a model, C++ restricts named object definitions \nto ensure that linking will behave deterministically by requiring a single definition for an object \nacross all translation units. This model is called the one-definition rule (ODR), which is defined \nby the C++ Standard, [basic.def.odr] in paragraph 4 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014]: \nEvery program shall contain exactly one definition of every non-inline function or variable \nthat is odr-used in that program; no diagnostic required. The definition can appear \nexplicitly in the program, it can be found in the standard or a user-defined library, or \n(when appropriate) it is implicitly defined. An inline function shall be defined in every \ntranslation unit in which it is odr-used. \nThe most common approach to multitranslation unit compilation involves declarations residing in \na header file that is subsequently made available to a source file via #include. These \ndeclarations are often also definitions, such as class and function template definitions. This \napproach is allowed by an exception defined in paragraph 6, which, in part, states the following: \nThere can be more than one definition of a class type, enumeration type, inline function \nwith external linkage, class template, non-static function template, static data member of \na class template, member function of a class template, or template specialization for \nwhich some template parameters are not specified in a program provided that each \ndefinition appears in a different translation unit, and provided the definitions satisfy the \nfollowing requirements. Given such an entity named D defined in more than one \ntranslation unit.... \nIf the definitions of D satisfy all these requirements, then the program shall behave as if \nthere were a single definition of D. If the definitions of D do not satisfy these \nrequirements, then the behavior is undefined. \nThe requirements specified by paragraph 6 essentially state that that two definitions must be \nidentical (not simply equivalent). Consequently, a definition introduced in two separate translation \nunits by an #include directive generally will not violate the ODR because the definitions are \nidentical in both translation units. \nHowever, it is possible to violate the ODR of a definition introduced via #include using block \nlanguage linkage specifications, vendor-specific language extensions, and so on. A more likely \nscenario for ODR violations is that accidental definitions of differing objects will exist in different \ntranslation units. \nDo not violate the one-definition rule; violations result in undefined behavior. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

Although the two definitions are functionally equivalent (they both \ndefine a class named S with a single, public, nonstatic data member int a), they are not defined \nusing the same sequence of tokens.

However, one of the translation units uses an implementation-defined #pragma that \nis supported by Microsoft Visual Studio to specify structure field alignment requirements. \nConsequently, the two class definitions may have differing layouts in each translation unit, which \nis a violation of the ODR. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

Consequently, when init_s() initializes the data members of s, it may result in a \nbuffer overrun. \nFor more information on the behavior of #pragma pack, see the vendor documentation for \nyour implementation, such as Microsoft Visual Studio or GCC. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

Because f() is declared as an inline function, the \ndefinition of f() must be identical in all translation units. However, each translation unit has a \nunique instance of n, resulting in a violation of the ODR. \nconst int n = 42; \n \nint g(const int &lhs, const int &rhs); \n  \ninline int f(int k) { \n  return g(k, n); \n} \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

This solution is compliant but it is not ideal. It may not be possible (or \ndesirable) to modify the signature of g(), such as if g() represented std::max() from \n<algorithm>. Also, because of the differing linkage used by n and f(), accidental violations \nof the ODR are still likely if the definition of f() is modified to odr-use n. \nconst int n = 42; \n \nint g(int lhs, int rhs); \n  \ninline int f(int k) { \n  return g(k, n); \n} \n2.11.8 Compliant Solution \nIn this compliant solution, the constant object n is replaced with an enumerator of the same name. \nNamed enumerations defined at namespace scope have the same linkage as the namespace they \nare contained in. The global namespace has external linkage, so the definition of the named \nenumeration and its contained enumerators also have external linkage. Although less aesthetically \npleasing, this compliant solution does not suffer from the same maintenance burdens of the \nprevious code because n and f() have the same linkage. \nenum Constants { \n  N = 42 \n}; \n \nint g(const int &lhs, const int &rhs); \n  \ninline int f(int k) { \n  return g(k, N); \n} \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL60-CPP.

As shown in “Support for Whole-Program Analysis and the Verification of the \nOne-Definition Rule in C++” [Quinlan 2006], failing to enforce the ODR enables a virtual \nfunction pointer attack known as the VPTR exploit. In this exploit, an object’s virtual function \ntable is corrupted so that calling a virtual function on the object results in malicious code being \nexecuted. See the paper by Quinlan and colleagues for more details. However, note that to \nintroduce the malicious class, the attacker must have access to the system building the code. \nRule \nSeverity \nLikelihood \nRemediation Cost \nPriority \nLevel \nDCL60-CPP \nHigh \nUnlikely \nHigh \nP3 \nL3 \n2.11.10 \nBibliography \n[ISO/IEC 14882-2014] \nSubclause 3.2, “One Definition Rule” \n[Quinlan 2006] \n \nExpressions (EXP) - EXP50-CPP.

A strict weak ordering has the following properties: \n• \nfor all x: x < x == false (irreflexivity) \n• \nfor all x, y: if x < y then !(y < x) (asymmetry) \n• \nfor all x, y, z: if x < y && y < z then x < z (transitivity) \nProviding an invalid ordering predicate for an associative container (e.g., sets, maps, multisets, \nand multimaps), or as a comparison criterion with the sorting algorithms, can result in erratic \nbehavior or infinite loops [Meyers 2001]. When an ordering predicate is required for an \nassociative container or a generic standard template library algorithm, the predicate must meet the \nrequirements for inducing a strict weak ordering. \n5.8.1 \nNoncompliant Code Example \nIn this noncompliant code example, the std::set object is created with a comparator that does \nnot adhere to the strict weak ordering requirement.

Ensure your random number generator is properly \nseeded \nA pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) is a deterministic algorithm capable of generating \nsequences of numbers that approximate the properties of random numbers. Each sequence is \ncompletely determined by the initial state of the PRNG and the algorithm for changing the state. \nMost PRNGs make it possible to set the initial state, also called the seed state. Setting the initial \nstate is called seeding the PRNG. \nCalling a PRNG in the same initial state, either without seeding it explicitly or by seeding it with a \nconstant value, results in generating the same sequence of random numbers in different runs of the \nprogram. Consider a PRNG function that is seeded with some initial seed value and is \nconsecutively called to produce a sequence of random numbers. If the PRNG is subsequently \nseeded with the same initial seed value, then it will generate the same sequence. \nConsequently, after the first run of an improperly seeded PRNG, an attacker can predict the \nsequence of random numbers that will be generated in the future runs. Improperly seeding or \nfailing to seed the PRNG can lead to vulnerabilities, especially in security protocols. \nThe solution is to ensure that a PRNG is always properly seeded with an initial seed value that \nwill not be predictable or controllable by an attacker. A properly seeded PRNG will generate a \ndifferent sequence of random numbers each time it is run. \nNot all random number generators can be seeded. True random number generators that rely on \nhardware to produce completely unpredictable results do not need to be and cannot be seeded. \nSome high-quality PRNGs, such as the /dev/random device on some UNIX systems, also \ncannot be seeded. This rule applies only to algorithmic PRNGs that can be seeded. \n12.2.1 Noncompliant Code Example \nThis noncompliant code example generates a sequence of 10 pseudorandom numbers using the \nMersenne Twister engine. No matter how many times this code is executed, it always produces \nthe same sequence because the default seed is used for the engine. \n#include <random> \n#include <iostream> \n \nvoid f() { \n  std::mt19937 engine; \n   \n  for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) { \n    std::cout << engine() << ", "; \n  } \n} \nMiscellaneous (MSC) - MSC51-CPP.

These actions are called side effects. All relationships between value \ncomputations and side effects can be described in terms of sequencing of their evaluations. The \nC++ Standard, [intro.execution], paragraph 13 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], establishes three \nsequencing terms: \nSequenced before is an asymmetric, transitive, pair-wise relation between evaluations \nexecuted by a single thread, which induces a partial order among those evaluations. \nGiven any two evaluations A and B, if A is sequenced before B, then the execution of A \nshall precede the execution of B.

Avoid deadlock by locking in a predefined order \nMutexes are used to prevent multiple threads from causing a data race by accessing the same \nshared resource at the same time. Sometimes, when locking mutexes, multiple threads hold each \nother’s lock, and the program consequently deadlocks. Four conditions are required for deadlock \nto occur: \n• \nmutual exclusion (At least one nonshareable resource must be held.),  \n• \nhold and wait (A thread must hold a resource while awaiting availability of another \nresource.),  \n• \nno preemption (Resources cannot be taken away from a thread while they are in-use.), and  \n• \ncircular wait (A thread must await a resource held by another thread which is, in turn, \nawaiting a resource held by the first thread.). \nDeadlock needs all four conditions, so preventing deadlock requires preventing any one of the \nfour conditions. One simple solution is to lock the mutexes in a predefined order, which prevents \ncircular wait. \n11.4.1 Noncompliant Code Example \nThe behavior of this noncompliant code example depends on the runtime environment and the \nplatform’s scheduler.

Avoid cycles during initialization of static objects \nThe C++ Standard, [stmt.dcl], paragraph 4 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the following: \nThe zero-initialization (8.5) of all block-scope variables with static storage duration \n(3.7.1) or thread storage duration (3.7.2) is performed before any other initialization \ntakes place. Constant initialization (3.6.2) of a block-scope entity with static storage \nduration, if applicable, is performed before its block is first entered. An implementation is \npermitted to perform early initialization of other block-scope variables with static or \nthread storage duration under the same conditions that an implementation is permitted \nto statically initialize a variable with static or thread storage duration in namespace \nscope (3.6.2). Otherwise such a variable is initialized the first time control passes \nthrough its declaration; such a variable is considered initialized upon the completion of \nits initialization. If the initialization exits by throwing an exception, the initialization is not \ncomplete, so it will be tried again the next time control enters the declaration. If control \nenters the declaration concurrently while the variable is being initialized, the concurrent \nexecution shall wait for completion of the initialization. If control re-enters the declaration \nrecursively while the variable is being initialized, the behavior is undefined. \nDo not reenter a function during the initialization of a static variable declaration. If a function is \nreentered during the constant initialization of a static object inside that function, the behavior of \nthe program is undefined. Infinite recursion is not required to trigger undefined behavior, the \nfunction need only recur once as part of the initialization. Due to thread-safe initialization of \nvariables, a single, recursive call will often result in a deadlock due to locking a non-recursive \nsynchronization primitive. \nAdditionally, the C++ Standard, [basic.start.init], paragraph 2, in part, states the following: \nDynamic initialization of a non-local variable with static storage duration is either ordered \nor unordered. Definitions of explicitly specialized class template static data members \nhave ordered initialization. Other class template static data members (i.e., implicitly or \nexplicitly instantiated specializations) have unordered initialization. Other non-local \nvariables with static storage duration have ordered initialization. Variables with ordered \ninitialization defined within a single translation unit shall be initialized in the order of their \ndefinitions in the translation unit. If a program starts a thread, the subsequent \ninitialization of a variable is unsequenced with respect to the initialization of a variable \ndefined in a different translation unit. Otherwise, the initialization of a variable is \nindeterminately sequenced with respect to the initialization of a variable defined in a \ndifferent translation unit. If a program starts a thread, the subsequent unordered \ninitialization of a variable is unsequenced with respect to every other dynamic \ninitialization. Otherwise, the unordered initialization of a variable is indeterminately \nsequenced with respect to every other dynamic initialization. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL56-CPP.

A signal handler must be a plain old function \nThe C++ Standard, [support.runtime], paragraph 10 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the following: \nThe common subset of the C and C++ languages consists of all declarations, definitions, \nand expressions that may appear in a well formed C++ program and also in a \nconforming C program. A POF (“plain old function”) is a function that uses only features \nfrom this common subset, and that does not directly or indirectly use any function that is \nnot a POF, except that it may use plain lock-free atomic operations. A plain lock-free \natomic operation is an invocation of a function f from Clause 29, such that f is not a \nmember function, and either f is the function atomic_is_lock_free, or for every \natomic argument A passed to f, atomic_is_lock_free(A) yields true. All signal \nhandlers shall have C linkage. The behavior of any function other than a POF used as a \nsignal handler in a C++ program is implementation-defined.228 \nFootnote 228 states the following: \nIn particular, a signal handler using exception handling is very likely to have problems. \nAlso, invoking std::exit may cause destruction of objects, including those of the \nstandard library implementation, which, in general, yields undefined behavior in a signal \nhandler. \nIf your signal handler is not a plain old function, then the behavior of a call to it in response to a \nsignal is implementation-defined, at best, and is likely to result in undefined behavior. All signal \nhandlers must meet the definition of a plain old function. In addition to the restrictions placed on \nsignal handlers in a C program, this definition also prohibits the use of features that exist in C++ \nbut not in C (such as non-POD [non–plain old data] objects and exceptions). This includes \nindirect use of such features through function calls.  \n12.5.1 Noncompliant Code Example \nIn this noncompliant code example, the signal handler is declared as a static function. \nHowever, since all signal handler functions must have C language linkage, and C++ is the default \nlanguage linkage for functions in C++, calling the signal handler results in undefined behavior. \n#include <csignal> \n \nstatic void sig_handler(int sig) { \n  // Implementation details elided. \n} \n \nvoid install_signal_handler() { \n  if (SIG_ERR == std::signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler)) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \nMiscellaneous (MSC) - MSC54-CPP.

As a \nconsequence of declaring the signal handler with C language linkage, the signal handler will have \nexternal linkage rather than internal linkage. \n#include <csignal> \n  \nextern "C" void sig_handler(int sig) { \n  // Implementation details elided. \n} \n \nvoid install_signal_handler() { \n  if (SIG_ERR == std::signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler)) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \n12.5.3 Noncompliant Code Example \nIn this noncompliant code example, a signal handler calls a function that allows exceptions, and it \nattempts to handle any exceptions thrown. Because exceptions are not part of the common subset \nof C and C++ features, this example results in implementation-defined behavior. However, it is \nunlikely that the implementation’s behavior will be suitable. For instance, on a stack-based \narchitecture where a signal is generated asynchronously (instead of as a result of a call to \nstd:abort() or std::raise()), it is possible that the stack frame is not properly \ninitialized, causing stack tracing to be unreliable and preventing the exception from being caught \nproperly. \n#include <csignal> \n \nstatic void g() noexcept(false); \n \nextern "C" void sig_handler(int sig) { \n  try { \n    g(); \n  } catch (...) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \n \nvoid install_signal_handler() { \n  if (SIG_ERR == std::signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler)) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \nMiscellaneous (MSC) - MSC54-CPP.

Even if g() were implemented such that it handled all exceptions and was \nmarked noexcept(true), it would still be noncompliant to call g()from a signal handler \nbecause g() would still use a feature that is not a part of the common subset of C and C++ \nfeatures allowed by a signal handler. Therefore, this compliant solution removes the call to g() \nfrom the signal handler and instead polls a variable of type volatile sig_atomic_t \nperiodically; if the variable is set to 1 in the signal handler, then g() is called to respond to the \nsignal. \n#include <csignal> \n \nvolatile sig_atomic_t signal_flag = 0; \nstatic void g() noexcept(false); \n \nextern "C" void sig_handler(int sig) { \n  signal_flag = 1; \n} \n \nvoid install_signal_handler() { \n  if (SIG_ERR == std::signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler)) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \n \n// Called periodically to poll the signal flag. \nvoid poll_signal_flag() { \n  if (signal_flag == 1) { \n    signal_flag = 0; \n    try { \n      g(); \n    } catch(...) { \n      // Handle error \n    } \n  } \n} \nMiscellaneous (MSC) - MSC54-CPP.

Do not depend on the order of evaluation for side \neffects \nIn C++, modifying an object, calling a library I/O function, accessing a volatile-qualified \nvalue, or calling a function that performs one of these actions are ways to modify the state of the \nexecution environment. These actions are called side effects. All relationships between value \ncomputations and side effects can be described in terms of sequencing of their evaluations. The \nC++ Standard, [intro.execution], paragraph 13 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], establishes three \nsequencing terms: \nSequenced before is an asymmetric, transitive, pair-wise relation between evaluations \nexecuted by a single thread, which induces a partial order among those evaluations. \nGiven any two evaluations A and B, if A is sequenced before B, then the execution of A \nshall precede the execution of B. If A is not sequenced before B and B is not sequenced \nbefore A, then A and B are unsequenced. [Note: The execution of unsequenced \nevaluations can overlap. — end note] Evaluations A and B are indeterminately \nsequenced when either A is sequenced before B or B is sequenced before A, but it is \nunspecified which. [Note: Indeterminately sequenced evaluations cannot overlap, but \neither could be executed first. — end note] \nParagraph 15 further states (nonnormative text removed for brevity) the following: \nExcept where noted, evaluations of operands of individual operators and of \nsubexpressions of individual expressions are unsequenced. ... The value computations \nof the operands of an operator are sequenced before the value computation of the result \nof the operator. If a side effect on a scalar object is unsequenced relative to either \nanother side effect on the same scalar object or a value computation using the value of \nthe same scalar object, and they are not potentially concurrent, the behavior is \nundefined. ... When calling a function (whether or not the function is inline), every value \ncomputation and side effect associated with any argument expression, or with the postfix \nexpression designating the called function, is sequenced before execution of every \nexpression or statement in the body of the called function. ... Every evaluation in the \ncalling function (including other function calls) that is not otherwise specifically \nsequenced before or after the execution of the body of the called function is \nindeterminately sequenced with respect to the execution of the called function. Several \ncontexts in C++ cause evaluation of a function call, even though no corresponding \nfunction call syntax appears in the translation unit. ... The sequencing constraints on the \nexecution of the called function (as described above) are features of the function calls as \nevaluated, whatever the syntax of the expression that calls the function might be. \nExpressions (EXP) - EXP50-CPP.

([expr.post.incr], paragraph 1) \n• \nIn logical && expressions, if the second expression is evaluated, every value computation and \nside effect associated with the first expression is sequenced before every value computation \nand side effect associated with the second expression. ([expr.log.and], paragraph 2) \n• \nIn logical || expressions, if the second expression is evaluated, every value computation and \nside effect associated with the first expression is sequenced before every value computation \nand side effect associated with the second expression. ([expr.log.or], paragraph 2) \n• \nIn conditional ?: expressions, every value computation and side effect associated with the \nfirst expression is sequenced before every value computation and side effect associated with \nthe second or third expression (whichever is evaluated). ([expr.cond], paragraph 1) \n• \nIn assignment expressions (including compound assignments), the assignment is sequenced \nafter the value computations of left and right operands and before the value computation of \nthe assignment expression. ([expr.ass], paragraph 1) \n• \nIn comma , expressions, every value computation and side effect associated with the left \nexpression is sequenced before every value computation and side effect associated with the \nright expression. ([expr.comma], paragraph 1) \n• \nWhen evaluating initializer lists, the value computation and side effect associated with each \ninitializer-clause is sequenced before every value computation and side effect associated with \na subsequent initializer-clause. ([dcl.init.list], paragraph 4) \n• \nWhen a signal handler is executed as a result of a call to std::raise(), the execution of \nthe handler is sequenced after the invocation of std::raise() and before its return. \n([intro.execution], paragraph 6) \n• \nThe completions of the destructors for all initialized objects with thread storage duration \nwithin a thread are sequenced before the initiation of the destructors of any object with static \nstorage duration. ([basic.start.term], paragraph 1) \n• \nIn a new-expression, initialization of an allocated object is sequenced before the value \ncomputation of the new-expression. ([expr.new], paragraph 18) \n• \nWhen a default constructor is called to initialize an element of an array and the constructor \nhas at least one default argument, the destruction of every temporary created in a default \nargument is sequenced before the construction of the next array element, if any. \n([class.temporary], paragraph 4) \n• \nThe destruction of a temporary whose lifetime is not extended by being bound to a reference \nis sequenced before the destruction of every temporary that is constructed earlier in the same \nfull-expression.

Avoid deadlock by locking in a predefined order \nMutexes are used to prevent multiple threads from causing a data race by accessing the same \nshared resource at the same time. Sometimes, when locking mutexes, multiple threads hold each \nother’s lock, and the program consequently deadlocks. Four conditions are required for deadlock \nto occur: \n• \nmutual exclusion (At least one nonshareable resource must be held.),  \n• \nhold and wait (A thread must hold a resource while awaiting availability of another \nresource.),  \n• \nno preemption (Resources cannot be taken away from a thread while they are in-use.), and  \n• \ncircular wait (A thread must await a resource held by another thread which is, in turn, \nawaiting a resource held by the first thread.). \nDeadlock needs all four conditions, so preventing deadlock requires preventing any one of the \nfour conditions.

Do not access freed memory \nEvaluating a pointer—including dereferencing the pointer, using it as an operand of an arithmetic \noperation, type casting it, and using it as the right-hand side of an assignment—into memory that \nhas been deallocated by a memory management function is undefined behavior. Pointers to \nmemory that has been deallocated are called dangling pointers. Accessing a dangling pointer can \nresult in exploitable vulnerabilities. \nIt is at the memory manager’s discretion when to reallocate or recycle the freed memory. When \nmemory is freed, all pointers into it become invalid, and its contents might either be returned to \nthe operating system, making the freed space inaccessible, or remain intact and accessible. As a \nresult, the data at the freed location can appear to be valid but change unexpectedly. \nConsequently, memory must not be written to or read from once it is freed. \n7.1.1 \nNoncompliant Code Example (new and delete) \nIn this noncompliant code example, s is dereferenced after it has been deallocated. If this access \nresults in a write-after-free, the vulnerability can be exploited to run arbitrary code with the \npermissions of the vulnerable process. Typically, dynamic memory allocations and deallocations \nare far removed, making it difficult to recognize and diagnose such problems. \n#include <new> \n \nstruct S { \n  void f(); \n}; \n \nvoid g() noexcept(false) { \n  S *s = new S; \n  // ... \n  delete s; \n  // ... \n  s->f(); \n} \nThe function g() is marked noexcept(false) to comply with MEM52-CPP.

Avoid cycles during initialization of static objects \nThe C++ Standard, [stmt.dcl], paragraph 4 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the following: \nThe zero-initialization (8.5) of all block-scope variables with static storage duration \n(3.7.1) or thread storage duration (3.7.2) is performed before any other initialization \ntakes place. Constant initialization (3.6.2) of a block-scope entity with static storage \nduration, if applicable, is performed before its block is first entered. An implementation is \npermitted to perform early initialization of other block-scope variables with static or \nthread storage duration under the same conditions that an implementation is permitted \nto statically initialize a variable with static or thread storage duration in namespace \nscope (3.6.2). Otherwise such a variable is initialized the first time control passes \nthrough its declaration; such a variable is considered initialized upon the completion of \nits initialization. If the initialization exits by throwing an exception, the initialization is not \ncomplete, so it will be tried again the next time control enters the declaration. If control \nenters the declaration concurrently while the variable is being initialized, the concurrent \nexecution shall wait for completion of the initialization. If control re-enters the declaration \nrecursively while the variable is being initialized, the behavior is undefined. \nDo not reenter a function during the initialization of a static variable declaration. If a function is \nreentered during the constant initialization of a static object inside that function, the behavior of \nthe program is undefined. Infinite recursion is not required to trigger undefined behavior, the \nfunction need only recur once as part of the initialization. Due to thread-safe initialization of \nvariables, a single, recursive call will often result in a deadlock due to locking a non-recursive \nsynchronization primitive. \nAdditionally, the C++ Standard, [basic.start.init], paragraph 2, in part, states the following: \nDynamic initialization of a non-local variable with static storage duration is either ordered \nor unordered. Definitions of explicitly specialized class template static data members \nhave ordered initialization. Other class template static data members (i.e., implicitly or \nexplicitly instantiated specializations) have unordered initialization. Other non-local \nvariables with static storage duration have ordered initialization. Variables with ordered \ninitialization defined within a single translation unit shall be initialized in the order of their \ndefinitions in the translation unit. If a program starts a thread, the subsequent \ninitialization of a variable is unsequenced with respect to the initialization of a variable \ndefined in a different translation unit. Otherwise, the initialization of a variable is \nindeterminately sequenced with respect to the initialization of a variable defined in a \ndifferent translation unit. If a program starts a thread, the subsequent unordered \ninitialization of a variable is unsequenced with respect to every other dynamic \ninitialization. Otherwise, the unordered initialization of a variable is indeterminately \nsequenced with respect to every other dynamic initialization. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL56-CPP.

Unordered initialization, especially prevalent \nacross translation unit boundaries, results in unspecified behavior. \n2.7.1 \nNoncompliant Code Example \nThis noncompliant example attempts to implement an efficient factorial function using caching. \nBecause the initialization of the static local array cache involves recursion, the behavior of the \nfunction is undefined, even though the recursion is not infinite. \n#include <stdexcept> \n \nint fact(int i) noexcept(false) { \n  if (i < 0) { \n    // Negative factorials are undefined. \n    throw std::domain_error("i must be >= 0"); \n  } \n  \n  static const int cache[] = { \n    fact(0), fact(1), fact(2), fact(3), fact(4), fact(5), \n    fact(6), fact(7), fact(8), fact(9), fact(10), fact(11), \n    fact(12), fact(13), fact(14), fact(15), fact(16) \n  }; \n  \n  if (i < (sizeof(cache) / sizeof(int))) { \n    return cache[i]; \n  } \n  \n  return i > 0 ? i * fact(i - 1) : 1; \n} \n2.7.1.1 Implementation Details \nIn Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and GCC 6.1.0, the recursive initialization of cache deadlocks \nwhile initializing the static variable in a thread-safe manner. \nDeclarations and Initialization (DCL) - DCL56-CPP.

A signal handler must be a plain old function \nThe C++ Standard, [support.runtime], paragraph 10 [ISO/IEC 14882-2014], states the following: \nThe common subset of the C and C++ languages consists of all declarations, definitions, \nand expressions that may appear in a well formed C++ program and also in a \nconforming C program. A POF (“plain old function”) is a function that uses only features \nfrom this common subset, and that does not directly or indirectly use any function that is \nnot a POF, except that it may use plain lock-free atomic operations. A plain lock-free \natomic operation is an invocation of a function f from Clause 29, such that f is not a \nmember function, and either f is the function atomic_is_lock_free, or for every \natomic argument A passed to f, atomic_is_lock_free(A) yields true. All signal \nhandlers shall have C linkage. The behavior of any function other than a POF used as a \nsignal handler in a C++ program is implementation-defined.228 \nFootnote 228 states the following: \nIn particular, a signal handler using exception handling is very likely to have problems. \nAlso, invoking std::exit may cause destruction of objects, including those of the \nstandard library implementation, which, in general, yields undefined behavior in a signal \nhandler. \nIf your signal handler is not a plain old function, then the behavior of a call to it in response to a \nsignal is implementation-defined, at best, and is likely to result in undefined behavior. All signal \nhandlers must meet the definition of a plain old function. In addition to the restrictions placed on \nsignal handlers in a C program, this definition also prohibits the use of features that exist in C++ \nbut not in C (such as non-POD [non–plain old data] objects and exceptions). This includes \nindirect use of such features through function calls.  \n12.5.1 Noncompliant Code Example \nIn this noncompliant code example, the signal handler is declared as a static function. \nHowever, since all signal handler functions must have C language linkage, and C++ is the default \nlanguage linkage for functions in C++, calling the signal handler results in undefined behavior. \n#include <csignal> \n \nstatic void sig_handler(int sig) { \n  // Implementation details elided. \n} \n \nvoid install_signal_handler() { \n  if (SIG_ERR == std::signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler)) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \nMiscellaneous (MSC) - MSC54-CPP. A signal handler must be a plain old function \nSEI CERT C++ CODING STANDARD (2016 EDITION) | V01 \n \n408 \nSoftware Engineering Institute | Carnegie Mellon University  \n \n[DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A] Approved for public release and unlimited distribution. \n12.5.2 Compliant Solution \nThis compliant solution defines sig_handler() as having C language linkage. As a \nconsequence of declaring the signal handler with C language linkage, the signal handler will have \nexternal linkage rather than internal linkage. \n#include <csignal> \n  \nextern "C" void sig_handler(int sig) { \n  // Implementation details elided. \n} \n \nvoid install_signal_handler() { \n  if (SIG_ERR == std::signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler)) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \n12.5.3 Noncompliant Code Example \nIn this noncompliant code example, a signal handler calls a function that allows exceptions, and it \nattempts to handle any exceptions thrown. Because exceptions are not part of the common subset \nof C and C++ features, this example results in implementation-defined behavior. However, it is \nunlikely that the implementation’s behavior will be suitable. For instance, on a stack-based \narchitecture where a signal is generated asynchronously (instead of as a result of a call to \nstd:abort() or std::raise()), it is possible that the stack frame is not properly \ninitialized, causing stack tracing to be unreliable and preventing the exception from being caught \nproperly. \n#include <csignal> \n \nstatic void g() noexcept(false); \n \nextern "C" void sig_handler(int sig) { \n  try { \n    g(); \n  } catch (...) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \n \nvoid install_signal_handler() { \n  if (SIG_ERR == std::signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler)) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \nMiscellaneous (MSC) - MSC54-CPP.

Even if g() were implemented such that it handled all exceptions and was \nmarked noexcept(true), it would still be noncompliant to call g()from a signal handler \nbecause g() would still use a feature that is not a part of the common subset of C and C++ \nfeatures allowed by a signal handler. Therefore, this compliant solution removes the call to g() \nfrom the signal handler and instead polls a variable of type volatile sig_atomic_t \nperiodically; if the variable is set to 1 in the signal handler, then g() is called to respond to the \nsignal. \n#include <csignal> \n \nvolatile sig_atomic_t signal_flag = 0; \nstatic void g() noexcept(false); \n \nextern "C" void sig_handler(int sig) { \n  signal_flag = 1; \n} \n \nvoid install_signal_handler() { \n  if (SIG_ERR == std::signal(SIGTERM, sig_handler)) { \n    // Handle error \n  } \n} \n \n// Called periodically to poll the signal flag. \nvoid poll_signal_flag() { \n  if (signal_flag == 1) { \n    signal_flag = 0; \n    try { \n      g(); \n    } catch(...) { \n      // Handle error \n    } \n  } \n} \nMiscellaneous (MSC) - MSC54-CPP.

Given the number of features that exist in C++ that do not \nalso exist in C, the consequences that arise from failure to comply with this rule can range from \nbenign (harmless) behavior to abnormal program termination, or even arbitrary code execution. \nRule \nSeverity \nLikelihood \nRemediation Cost \nPriority \nLevel \nMSC54-CPP \nHigh \nProbable \nHigh \nP6 \nL2 \n12.5.6 Related Guidelines \nSEI CERT C Coding Standard \nSIG30-C.

Do not use std::rand() for generating pseudorandom \nnumbers \nPseudorandom number generators use mathematical algorithms to produce a sequence of numbers \nwith good statistical properties, but the numbers produced are not genuinely random. \nThe C Standard rand() function, exposed through the C++ standard library through \n<cstdlib> as std::rand(), makes no guarantees as to the quality of the random sequence \nproduced. The numbers generated by some implementations of std::rand() have a \ncomparatively short cycle, and the numbers can be predictable. Applications that have strong \npseudorandom number requirements must use a generator that is known to be sufficient for their \nneeds. \n12.1.1 Noncompliant Code Example \nThe following noncompliant code generates an ID with a numeric part produced by calling the \nrand() function. The IDs produced are predictable and have limited randomness. Further, \ndepending on the value of RAND_MAX, the resulting value can have modulo bias. \n#include <cstdlib> \n#include <string> \n \nvoid f() { \n  std::string id("ID"); // Holds the ID, starting with the \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n // characters "ID" followed by a \n                        // random integer in the range [0-10000]. \n  id += std::to_string(std::rand() % 10000); \n  // ... \n} \nMiscellaneous (MSC) - MSC50-CPP.

It breaks random number generation into two parts: one is the algorithm \nresponsible for providing random values (the engine), and the other is responsible for distribution \nof the random values via a density function (the distribution). The distribution object is not strictly \nrequired, but it works to ensure that values are properly distributed within a given range instead of \nimproperly distributed due to bias issues. This compliant solution uses the Mersenne Twister \nalgorithm as the engine for generating random values and a uniform distribution to negate the \nmodulo bias from the noncompliant code example. \n#include <random> \n#include <string> \n \nvoid f() { \n  std::string id("ID"); // Holds the ID, starting with the  \n                        // characters "ID" followed by a random \n                        // integer in the range [0-10000]. \n  std::uniform_int_distribution<int> distribution(0, 10000); \n  std::random_device rd; \n  std::mt19937 engine(rd()); \n  id += std::to_string(distribution(engine)); \n  // ... \n} \nThis compliant solution also seeds the random number engine, in conformance with MSC51-CPP. \nEnsure your random number generator is properly seeded. \n12.1.3 Risk Assessment \nUsing the std::rand() function could lead to predictable random numbers. \nRule \nSeverity \nLikelihood \nRemediation Cost \nPriority \nLevel \nMSC50-CPP \nMedium \nUnlikely \nLow \nP6 \nL2 \nMiscellaneous (MSC) - MSC50-CPP.

Close files when they are no longer needed \nA call to the std::basic_filebuf<T>::open() function must be matched with a call to \nstd::basic_filebuf<T>::close() before the lifetime of the last pointer that stores the \nreturn value of the call has ended or before normal program termination, whichever occurs first. \nNote that std::basic_ifstream<T>, std::basic_ofstream<T>, and \nstd::basic_fstream<T> all maintain an internal reference to a \nstd::basic_filebuf<T> object on which open() and close() are called as needed. \nProperly managing an object of one of these types (by not leaking the object) is sufficient to \nensure compliance with this rule. Often, the best solution is to use the stream object by value \nsemantics instead of via dynamic memory allocation, ensuring compliance with MEM51-CPP. \nProperly deallocate dynamically allocated resources. However, that is still insufficient for \nsituations in which destructors are not automatically called. \n8.2.1 \nNoncompliant Code Example \nIn this noncompliant code example, a std::fstream object file is constructed. The \nconstructor for std::fstream calls std::basic_filebuf<T>::open(), and the \ndefault std::terminate_handler called by std::terminate() is std::abort(), \nwhich does not call destructors. Consequently, the underlying std::basic_filebuf<T> \nobject maintained by the object is not properly closed. \n#include <exception> \n#include <fstream> \n#include <string> \n \nvoid f(const std::string &fileName) { \n  std::fstream file(fileName); \n  if (!file.is_open()) { \n    // Handle error \n    return; \n  } \n  // ... \n  std::terminate(); \n} \nThis noncompliant code example and the subsequent compliant solutions are assumed to \neventually call std::terminate() in accordance with the ERR50-CPP-EX1 exception \ndescribed in ERR50-CPP.
