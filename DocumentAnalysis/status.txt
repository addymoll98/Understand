I'm relly not getting good results trying to compare the DAFMANs to the CERT C++
documents. Part of the issue I think is that they are such different scopes. The
DAFMAN are very broad, whereas the CERT C++ are very specific examples of specific
things. I'm thinking I'll need to take a different approach. This approach of 
comparing each thing to each other isn't going to work well.
