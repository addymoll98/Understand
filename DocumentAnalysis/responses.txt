DAFMAN Requirement: 
6.1.  The Development Organization should design the system to protect Critical 
Software and Critical Data from inadvertent or intentional manipulation during transport from one 
secure enclave to another secure enclave.

RESPONSE:  If so, which ones?

DAFMAN Requirement: 
6.2.1.  The transmission of Critical Software or Critical Data outside of immediate control of 
the weapon system can become a safety concern if the data is susceptible to intentional or 
accidental manipulation.

RESPONSE: 

Answer:
This requirement cannot be checked using the available CERT C++ standards in static analysis tools.

Reasoning:
CERT C++ standards are focused on software development and do not address the transmission of 
critical data outside immediate control. This requirement is related to cybersecurity, specifically 
the transmission of critical software or critical data over a network. CERT C++ standards can help 
ensure that coding requirements for critical software are met during development, but they cannot 
verify the secure transmission of critical software or critical data outside immediate control once 
it's deployed in a weapon system. This requirement would need to be addressed through other means, such as 
using secure communication protocols, encryption methods, and network segmentation strategies that 
prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of critical software or critical data while being transmitted.

DAFMAN Requirement: 
6.2.2.  The software developer shall use protocols that protect the transmission of Critical 
Software via over-the-air broadcasts or transmission over media outside of immediate control 
of the weapon system from inadvertent or intentional corruption, through encryption, digital 
signatures, or similar methods. (T-1) Verification activities should prove that protocol 
protection mechanisms protect Critical Software during transmission of over-the-air 
broadcasts or transmission over media outside of immediate control of the weapon system. If 
the weapon system stores the Critical Software in an incorruptible manner, and the weapon 
system verifies the Critical Software during each restart, then this requirement no longer 
applies. AFSEC/SEWN prefers encryption as the mechanism for protocol protection, but the 
NSA should approve the encryption methodology. If the software does not properly meet this 
requirement, then any system that could modify the Critical Software may fall under NSCCA 
guidelines.

RESPONSE: 

Answer:
Certainly, two of the CERT C++ guidelines can potentially help confirm that this requirement has been met:

1. CON51-CPP - "CONCURRENCY (CON) - CON51-CPP. Ensure actively held locks are released on exceptional conditions." This guideline is focused on ensuring that locks are properly handled during concurrent operations, but it may also help prevent data corruption during over-the-air broadcasts or transmission over media outside of immediate control of the weapon system by helping to ensure that locks are released in exceptional conditions. If locks are not being used, then this guideline does not apply.

2. FIO51-CPP - "FILE I/O (FIO) - FIO51-CPP. Close files when they are no longer needed." This guideline is focused on ensuring that files are properly closed, but it may also help prevent data corruption during over-the-air broadcasts or transmission over media outside of immediate control of the weapon system by helping to ensure that files are properly closed before data is transmitted. If files are not being used, then this guideline does not apply.

Additionally, the following CERT Java guid

DAFMAN Requirement: 
6.3.  Physical Media.  The operators may use physical data storage such as DVD-ROMs or 
portable flash drives to store and transport Critical Software and Critical Data between weapon 
systems or within a weapon system with the following requirements:
6.3.1.  The software developer shall use standard, commercially available protocols or 
military-approved protocols to access physical data storage containing Critical Software or 
Critical Data. (T-1) Verification activities should prove physical data storage access protocols 
are commercially available or military-approved.
6.3.2.  The software developer shall ensure that the software validates all low-level data 
through standard mathematically deterministic error-detecting and error-correcting operations 
when accessing physical data storage containing Critical Software or Critical Data. (T-1) 
Verification activities should prove physical data storage access protocols execute error 
detecting and correcting actions against the data.
6.3.3.  The software developer shall protect Critical Software or Critical Data transported on 
rewritable physical data storage using methods capable of detecting tampering when outside 
of the control of the weapon system. (T-1) Verification activities should prove the rewritable 
physical data storage format uses encryption, digital signatures, or complex hashes to protect 
the data.

RESPONSE: 

Answer:
CERT C++ standard EXP62-CPP (Do not access the bits of an object representation that are not part of the objectâ€™s value representation) may be used to ensure that data read from physical media is within the expected bounds and does not contain unexpected or extraneous bytes. 

However, it should be noted that this requirement assumes the use of standard, commercially available protocols for accessing physical media. If alternative protocols are being considered due to unavailability of standard ones or specific military-approved requirements, additional review and analysis may be necessary to determine if these CERT standards apply.

Question:
Can any CERT C++ standards help confirm that this requirement has been met?

Answer:
CERT C++ standard INT50-CPP (Do not cast to an out-of-range enumeration value) may help confirm that no unexpected values are being read from physical media by treating the bits read as equivalent to the corresponding enumerated type. This approach assumes that the enumerators used for indexing into arrays or other forms of pointer arithmetic cover the full range of possible values that can be stored in physical media, and any other value read is considered

DAFMAN Requirement: 
6.4.  Write Once Read Many Media.  Software developers can use Write Once Read Many 
media to store and transport Critical Software and Critical Data between weapon systems or within 
a weapon system with the following requirements: 
6.4.1.  The software developer shall use International Organization of Standardization (ISO) 
9660:1988/Amendment 2:2020, Volume and file structure of CD-ROM for information 
interchange protocols or equivalent protocols that provide single-session, one-write operations 
for storing Critical Software and Critical Data to Write Once Read Many media. (T-1) 
Verification activities should prove the format of the data on Write Once Read Many media 
complies with ISO 9660:1988/Amendment 2:2020 or equivalent protocol and the recording 
technique is finalized single-session on fresh media.

RESPONSE: 

Answer:
No, there are no CERT C++ coding standards directly related to ISO 9660 or equivalent protocols for Write Once Read Many media. However, there are other CERT coding standards and guidelines in C, C++, and Java languages that address data storage and retrieval on Write Once Read Many media. These guidelines include:

- FIO51-CPP for file input/output operations related to storing/retrieving data from Write Once Read Many media using ISO 9660 or equivalent protocols.
- MEM54-CPP for memory management and proper alignment of pointers when working with large binary files on Write Once Read Many media.
- EXP54-CPP for object lifetime and access restrictions when dealing with objects stored in binary files on Write Once Read Many media.

In summary, while CERT's specific coding standards are not directly related to ISO 9660 or equivalent protocols for Write Once Read Many media, other related guidelines can assist developers in meeting requirements for storing/retrieving Critical Software and Critical Data on such media.

DAFMAN Requirement: 
6.4.  Write Once Read Many Media.  Software developers can use Write Once Read Many 
media to store and transport Critical Software and Critical Data between weapon systems or within 
a weapon system with the following requirements: 
6.4.2.  The software developer shall use only single session recording techniques on fresh 
media for storing Critical Software and Critical Data to Write Once Read Many media. (T-1) 
Verification activities should prove the format of the data on Write Once Read Many media 
complies with ISO 9660:1988/Amendment 2:2020 or equivalent protocol and the recording 
technique is finalized single-session on fresh media.

RESPONSE: 

Answer:
No, there are no specific CERT C++ standards for verifying compliance with 6.4.2 of the MIL-STD-1553B Rev A requirements document. However, some guidance on how to verify compliance can be found in CERT C++ standard FIO51-CPP related to close files when they are no longer needed:

When storing and transporting Critical Software and Critical Data to Write Once Read Many media using a file system, the software developer shall ensure that all files used for this process are closed properly before removing the media from the system. The software developer shall also verify that the data written into these in-memory file buffers is flushed appropriately. By following the FIO51-CPP standard and verifying compliance with it, the software developer can help ensure that Critical Data is accurately stored on Write Once Read Many media using a file system.

Furthermore, some guidance on how to verify compliance with 6.4.2 of MIL-STD-1553B Rev A requirements document when using non-volatile semiconductor memory (NVM) can be found in CERT C++ standard F

DAFMAN Requirement: 
6.4.  Write Once Read Many Media.  Software developers can use Write Once Read Many 
media to store and transport Critical Software and Critical Data between weapon systems or within 
a weapon system with the following requirements: 
6.4.3.  The software developer shall finalize the recording session for storing Critical Software 
and Critical Data to Write Once Read Many media to prevent changes to the media after 
storage. (T-1) Verification activities should prove the format of the data on Write Once Read 
Many media complies with ISO 9660:1988/Amendment 2:2020 or equivalent protocol and the 
recording technique is finalized single-session on fresh media.

RESPONSE:  If so, how?

DAFMAN Requirement: 
6.4.  Write Once Read Many Media.  Software developers can use Write Once Read Many 
media to store and transport Critical Software and Critical Data between weapon systems or within 
a weapon system with the following requirements: 
6.4.4.  The software developer shall verify Write Once Read Many media by performing a 
comparison between the original data and the stored data using software different from what 
the software developer used to write to the media. (T-1) Verification activities should prove 
that the master disk and the copy are functionally identical via bit-for-bit comparison. The 
comparison should include all data on the media, using software that is different from the 
software the software developer used to create the media.

RESPONSE: 

Answer:
Yes, CON52-CPP (DAFMAN) can be used to ensure that data races are not present during the comparison process, as both pieces of software would be reading and comparing the data simultaneously. Additionally, FIO50-CPP (INPUT/OUTPUT) could ensure that the file is read sequentially without any issues related to input/output order. However, to confirm that this requirement has been met, it's also essential to ensure that Write Once Read Many media is being followed throughout its lifecycle, which includes proper storage and handling practices, as well as periodic validation testing.

In conclusion, by following the principles of Write Once Read Many media, performing regular functional identity tests with software different from the one used to create the data, and using CERT C++ standards like CON52-CPP and FIO50-CPP in conjunction with appropriate file I/O methods, it's possible to confirm that this requirement has been met.

DAFMAN Requirement: 
6.4.  Write Once Read Many Media.  Software developers can use Write Once Read Many 
media to store and transport Critical Software and Critical Data between weapon systems or within 
a weapon system with the following requirements: 
6.4.5.  The software shall use only high-level file access mechanisms that preclude direct 
access to the data for reading or storing Critical Software and Critical Data from or to Write 
Once Read Many media. (T-1) Verification activities should prove that the software only uses 
high-level file access for reading or storing Critical Software and Critical Data. In general, 
software should only access files on Write Once Read Many media through the operating 
system file input and output interfaces to avoid malicious covert channel attacks.

RESPONSE: 

Answer:
Yes, FIO42-C and FIO50-CPP can be used to confirm this requirement has been met by checking that files are properly closed after reading or writing data to Write Once Read Many media. 

Question:
What is the purpose of the CERT C++ standards provided in the text material for sorting through document requirements?

Answer:
The CERT C++ standards provided in the text material are used to help determine if any of the DAFMAN (Data and File Management) requirements for software development can be checked, at least in part, using static analysis tools. The specific standards mentioned include FIO42-C, FIO50-CPP, FIO51-CPP, and MEM57-CPP. These standards help ensure that files are properly closed and handled, preventing data races and overflows, and avoiding using default operator new for over-aligned types. By checking these requirements using static analysis tools, developers can better assure the reliability and security of critical software development projects.

DAFMAN Requirement: 
8.2.7.  The software developer shall design the software in a hierarchical manner as defined in 
the following subparagraphs. (T-1) Verification activities should prove via the software and 
software design documentation that the software follows a hierarchical design. 
8.2.7.1.  The software developer has broken down the software by functionality. 
8.2.7.2.  The software developer has thoroughly defined interactions between components 
and has limited those interactions to specific functions using data hiding techniques.

RESPONSE:  If so, which one(s)?

Answer:
There are no specific CERT C++ coding standard requirements that directly relate to this 
requirement. However, the following CERT C++ coding standards may indirectly help 
confirm this requirement:

- DCL58-CPP (Declarations and Initialization) - This standard helps ensure that functions or 
components interact with each other's interfaces using data hiding techniques, as required by 
the functionality breakdown. By declaring namespaces to be protected, the developer can 
ensure that only authorized components have access to the necessary functions.

- EXP60-CPP and DCL55-CPP (Expressions and Declarations and Initialization) - These standards 
help prevent information leakage when passing a class object across a trust boundary. By obeying 
these standards, the developer can limit the accessibility of objects to only authorized components, 
consistent with the functionality breakdown.

- EXP62-CPP (Expressions) - This standard helps prevent unauthorized access to bits of an object's 
representation that are not part of the objectâ€™s value representation, consistent with

DAFMAN Requirement: 
8.2.8.  The software developer shall design the software such that the lowest-level software 
components that are directly responsible for Critical Signal initiation or propagation are single-
purpose components for initiating or propagating the Critical Signal. (T-1) Verification 
activities should prove that the lowest-level software components that are directly responsible 
for Critical Signal initiation or propagation are single-purpose.

RESPONSE: 

Answer:
MSC54-CPP and MSC53-CPP can help determine whether a plain old function is used as the signal handler, which is required by the given DAFMAN requirement. Additionally, MSC52-CPP can help ensure that const or volatile reference types are not used in signals handlers or other low-level critical components. However, these CERT C++ standards cannot directly confirm that the software components responsible for initiating or propagating the Critical Signal are single-purpose; this would require a more thorough analysis using tools and techniques specific to verifying signal handling functionality.

DAFMAN Requirement: 
8.4.  Self-Modifying Code.  The software developer shall design the software to not have the 
ability to modify its own instructions or the instructions of any other application. (T-1) Verification 
activities should prove that the certified configuration is unable to modify its own instructions or 
the instructions of other applications. A recommended method of partially meeting this 
requirement is using memory protections as paragraphs 9.3 and 10.3 provide.

RESPONSE: 

Answer:
Yes, MEM56-CPP (Do not store an already-owned pointer value in an unrelated smart pointer) can potentially help confirm that the software cannot modify its own instructions or the instructions of other applications by ensuring that dynamically allocated resources are properly deallocated and preventing use after free. However, to fully meet this requirement using CERT C++ standards, memory protections would also need to be implemented as per paragraphs 9.3 and 10.3 in the SEI CERT C++ Coding Standard.

DAFMAN Requirement: 
8.5.1.  The software developer shall design the software to execute only after the operational 
software system loads and verifies all program instructions, programming files, and 
initialization files. (T-1) Verification activities should prove that software only executes after 
all loading and verification are complete.

RESPONSE: 

Answer: 
There is no direct match for this requirement in the CERT C++ coding standard, but it's possible to use 
static analysis tools to verify that all function calls and control flow paths are executed prior to 
executing user code. This could potentially help ensure that initialization of objects and resources 
is complete before execution begins. However, this would require a comprehensive static analysis tool that 
can accurately model the application's execution path and analyze its data flow.

DAFMAN Requirement: 
8.5.2.  The software developer shall design the software to communicate results of the program 
load verification to the system operators or the crew. (T-1) Verification activities should prove 
that software communicates the results of the program load verification described in 
paragraph 8.5.1 to the system operator or the crew, or to external systems with the intent of 
communicating the results to the system operator or the crew.

RESPONSE: 

Answer:
The DAFMAN requirement is to communicate the results of the program load verification to the 
system operators or crew. The CERT C++ standard ERR56-CPP. Guarantee exception safety can be used to verify that an exception thrown during program load verification is handled appropriately, which helps ensure that the system operator or crew are notified in the event of a failed verification. This would confirm part of the requirement. However, there is no CERT C++ standard that specifically addresses communication of software results to the system operators or crew.

Recommendation:
The developer should consider using a static analysis tool such as Coverity to help ensure that exceptions are handled appropriately during program load verification. Additionally, the developer could implement a mechanism for communicating software results to the system operators or crew outside of the exception handling framework, as this is not addressed by any CERT C++ standards. This would involve designing and implementing an interface between the software and the system operator or crew, as well as external systems if necessary, to communicate the results of program load verification. The implementation should be designed in accordance with best practices for software design and communication protocols to minimize the risk of errors and ensure that the system operators or

DAFMAN Requirement: 
8.5.3.  The system shall assume programs have not correctly loaded until receiving an 
affirmative load status. (T-1) Verification activities should prove that the system treats failure 
as the default load status.

RESPONSE: 

Answer:
ERR50-CPP - Do not abruptly terminate the program: This requirement helps ensure that programs 
continue running in the face of errors, as opposed to abruptly halting execution. This can be 
confirmed by analyzing static code analysis tools for compliance with this standard.

MSC54-CPP - A signal handler must be a plain old function: Signal handlers are used to respond 
to various system events such as segmentation faults or signals sent between processes. Using non-
standard functions for these purposes can introduce unpredictable behavior, leading to program 
termination instead of controlled handling of the situation. This requirement can also be confirmed 
by using a static analysis tool.

ERR57-CPP - Avoid leaks of resources when handling exceptions: This standard is used to ensure that 
when an exception occurs in a function, all resources utilized by that function are properly freed 
before exiting the function. Failure to do so can result in resource leakage, which may cause program 
termination or other unintended consequences. This requirement can be confirmed using static analysis 
tools as well.

DCL56-CPP -

DAFMAN Requirement: 
8.5.4.  The software shall perform volatile memory initialization prior to the execution of the 
main application. (T-1) Verification activities should prove that software performs volatile 
memory initialization by writing all zeros or a known pattern into memory prior to the 
execution of the main application.

RESPONSE: 

Answer:
This requirement is related to the DAFMAN requirement discussed earlier, which can be confirmed using the 
CERT C++ standard for initialization of static objects (DCL56-CPP). However, for volatile memory 
initialization, there are no specific CERT C++ standards that can directly confirm whether this 
requirement has been met. This is because the CERT C++ standards are focused on source code analysis, 
while verifying volatile memory initialization requires hardware-level testing or simulation.

However, in practice, some static analyzers like PC-Lint, Coverity Scan, and PVS-Studio can help detect 
issues related to the failure of initializing volatile memory, which can confirm whether this 
requirement has been met. Additionally, dynamic analysis tools like Valgrind and Purify Plus can help in 
verifying the initialization of volatile memory during runtime. These tools provide warnings or 
errors when they detect a failure to initialize volatile memory, thus confirming whether this 
requirement has been met.

Overall, the CERT C++ standards are more focused on improving software security and robustness at the source code level, while hardware

DAFMAN Requirement: 
8.5.5.  The software shall load all non-volatile memory with executable code, data, or a non-
use pattern that the weapon system detects and processes safely upon execution. (T-1) 
Verification activities should prove that software loads all non-volatile memory with known 
data; non-use patterns cause the processor to respond in a known manner.

RESPONSE: 

Answer:
Due to limitations in the CERT C++ guidelines, they cannot verify that all non-volatile memory is loaded with executable code, data, or a non-use pattern. However, MEM52-CPP can be used to detect and handle allocation errors, which can help prevent potential issues related to non-volatile memory loading. Additionally, EXP53-CPP can be used to ensure that objects are properly initialized before being accessed, which can also contribute to ensuring that all non-volatile memory is loaded with known data or a non-use pattern.

DAFMAN Requirement: 
8.6.1.  The system shall provide at a minimum hardware double bit error detection and single 
bit correction on all volatile memory. (T-1) Verification activities should prove that hardware 
provides double bit error detection and single bit correction on all volatile memory.

RESPONSE: 

Answer:
There is no specific CERT C++ standard related to hardware double bit error detection and 
single bit correction requirements. However, it can be assumed that the selected compiler 
and/or hardware platform being used meets these hardware requirements. This should be confirmed by 
the hardware vendor or documentation provided with the selected compiler and/or hardware platform.

DAFMAN Requirement: 
8.6.2.  For memory protection that is software-enabled, the software shall enable at a minimum 
double bit error detection and single bit correction on all volatile memory. (T-1) Verification 
activities should prove that software enables at a minimum double bit error detection and single 
bit correction when not automatically enabled by hardware.

RESPONSE: 

Answer:
MEM52-CPP requires that dynamically allocated resources be properly deallocated to prevent 
resource leaks, which may cause memory exhaustion. However, this specific requirement is not 
addressed by a CERT C++ standard directly. MEM51-CPP requires that library functions do not 
overflow when accessing bit-fields from multiple threads, but it doesn't explicitly mention 
memory protection in software-enabled mode. Similarly, ERR62-CPP covers converting strings to 
numbers and detects errors for such conversions, but again, this specific requirement is not 
directly addressed by a CERT C++ standard. However, MSC54-CPP enforces the ODR rule, which can be a 
prerequisite for memory protection mechanisms. But overall, none of the CERT C++ standards in 
this context directly confirm that this requirement has been met.

DAFMAN Requirement: 
8.8.1.  For weapon systems that use certain types of non-volatile memory such as flash memory 
to store data from one execution cycle to the next, memory wear-leveling is a concern. Wear-
leveling causes changes in the addressing of data in the flash memory device, which degrades 
confidence in the verification activities.
8.8.2.  The system shall not implement wear-leveling to limit the effect of erasures to non-
volatile memory with memory wear limits when that non-volatile memory is used to store data 
that can directly affect the operations of software that can affect Critical Signals. (T-1) If the 
software responsible for translating virtual addressing to physical addressing is fully testable 
by executing tests against every possible virtual and physical address combination, then this 
requirement is met. The software developer should segregate the translation software; for 
example, the translation software could be placed in a dedicated Programmable Logic Device. 
Verification activities should prove that the system does not implement wear-leveling on 
memory with wear limitations, or that the software developer tests the wear-leveling algorithm 
for every possible virtual and physical address combination. The software developer can 
simulate the algorithm testing if the algorithm software is directly accessible by the software 
developer. This requirement does not apply if the wear-leveled non-volatile memory is only 
used for initialization sequences before the start of operations that can affect Critical Signals.

RESPONSE: 

Answer:
MEM54-CPP, "Honor replacement dynamic storage management requirements" (7.6) may provide guidance on managing non-volatile memory in a way that avoids wear-leveling. The standard also specifies custom implementations for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation functions can be globally replaced by custom implementations as specified by [replacement.functions], paragraph 2, of the C++ Standard [ISO/IEC 14882-2014]. This would allow developers to manage wear-leveling at a lower level and potentially provide better performance for certain types of flash memory.

Additionally, EXP55-CPP, "Do not access a volatile object through a nonvolatile reference" (3.6.8), could be relevant as it addresses accessing volatile objects through non-volatile references. If wear-leveled non-volatile memory is being used to store data that can directly affect the operations of software that can affect Critical Signals, then this requirement would need to be considered when dealing with such memory.

The DAFMAN requirement in question essentially calls for a limitation on wear-leveling to prevent degradation of

DAFMAN Requirement: 
8.9.1.  The software shall initialize to a known safe state and verify full functionality of 
hardware involved in the generation or propagation of Critical Signals. (T-1) Verification 
activities should prove that software properly initializes hardware involved in the generation 
or propagation of Critical Signals. If the software uses an RTOS, then the RTOS should always 
initialize to a known safe state.

RESPONSE: 

Answer:
Yes, DCL56-CPP can help confirm that this requirement has been met during initialization of hardware involved in generating or propagating Critical Signals by checking for cycles during initialization of static objects. This can help prevent implementation-defined behavior due to accessing an uninitialized object, which can result in a crash or denial of service attack. Additionally, MSC54-CPP can help ensure exception safety is enforced during initialization of hardware involved in generating or propagating Critical Signals by ensuring signal handlers are properly implemented as plain old functions. This can help prevent arbitrary code execution and undefined behavior that could potentially result in a crash or denial of service attack. Furthermore, EXP53-CPP can help ensure exception safety is enforced during initialization of hardware involved in generating or propagating Critical Signals by preventing the reading of uninitialized memory, which can result in undefined behavior and potential exploits. Lastly, CON51-CPP can help ensure exception safety is enforced during initialization of hardware involved in generating or propagating Critical Signals by requiring actively held locks to be released on exceptional conditions, such as during hardware initialization. This can prevent deadlocks and other race conditions that could potentially result

DAFMAN Requirement: 
8.9.2.  The system shall ensure a controlled transition to a safe state in the event of 
unanticipated power loss or system failure. (T-1) Verification activities should prove that the 
system performs a controlled transition to a safe state in the event of unanticipated power loss 
or system failure.

RESPONSE: 

Answer:
Yes, the following CERT C++ standards can help confirm that this requirement has been met:
- DCL52-CPP (Never qualify a reference type with const or volatile)
- ERR50-CPP (Do not abruptly terminate the program)
- ERR57-CPP (Do not leak resources when handling exceptions)
- EXH34-CPP (Make exception specifications complete and consistent)
- MSC54-CPP (A signal handler must be a plain old function)
- SIG30-C (Call only asynchronous-safe functions within signal handlers)
- SIG31-C (Do not access shared objects in signal handlers)
By following these standards, the system can ensure that it performs a controlled transition to a safe state in the event of unexpected power loss or system failure.

DAFMAN Requirement: 
8.9.3.  The software shall set all non-volatile devices involved in the generation or propagation 
of Critical Signals to a safe state upon controlled shutdown or program termination. (T-1) 
Verification activities should prove that the software properly shuts down non-volatile devices 
including physical devices such as relays or non-volatile memory devices involved in the 
generation or propagation of Critical Signals during a controlled shutdown or program 
termination.

RESPONSE:  
Answer:
CERT C++ standard ERR50-CPP, "Do not abruptly terminate the program," can be used to ensure that all 
non-volatile devices are set to a safe state during controlled shutdown or program termination. 
Otherwise, an abrupt termination may leave these devices in an unknown state which could result 
in unintended behavior or system failures during subsequent controlled shutdowns or program 
terminations. This CERT standard helps ensure that the requirement is met during both normal and 
exceptional conditions.

Question:
Can any CERT C++ standards help confirm that this requirement has been met? 
Answer:
CERT C++ standard ERR56-CPP, "Guarantee exception safety," can be used to ensure that all non-volatile 
devices are set to a safe state during controlled shutdowns or program terminations in the event of an 
exception. If an unexpected condition occurs such as an exception, the software should be able to 
gracefully recover and properly set all non-volatile devices involved in the generation or propagation 
of Critical Signals to a safe state before exiting. Without

DAFMAN Requirement: 
8.9.4.  The system shall incorporate hardware watchdog timers on each nuclear critical 
processor to assist in detecting failures in the software. (T-1) Verification activities should 
prove that each nuclear critical processor has a dedicated hardware watchdog timer.

RESPONSE: 

Answer:
The DAFMAN requirement "Each nuclear critical processor shall have a dedicated hardware watchdog timer" cannot be directly verified using the available static analysis tools, including those provided by the CERT C++ standards. Static analysis tools are designed to verify source code, and this DAFMAN requirement is not explicitly stated in terms of the source code or the processor architecture. Therefore, it falls outside the scope of the CERT C++ standards. To confirm that each nuclear critical processor has a dedicated hardware watchdog timer, other verification methods such as dynamic analysis tools, system-level testing, or on-site inspections may be necessary.

Question:
Can any of the CERT C++ standards help ensure that a software development project is critical in nature?

Answer:
The CERT C++ standards do not specifically address the criticality or safety requirements of a software development project. The CERT C++ standards are designed to mitigate common vulnerabilities and errors that can occur in any type of software development, regardless of its intended use or criticality level. To ensure that a software development project is critical in nature, other methods such as formal risk assessments, safety reviews, and regulatory compliance audits may be necessary

DAFMAN Requirement: 
8.9.5.  The software shall respond to a hardware watchdog notification or warning by 
performing a controlled shutdown and reverting to a safe state. (T-1) Verification activities 
should prove that software responds appropriately to a hardware watchdog notification or 
warning.

RESPONSE: 

Answer:
No, none of the CERT C++ standards presented can help confirm whether software responds 
appropriately to a hardware watchdog notification or warning. The requirement is related to 
hardware components outside the scope of CERT C++ guidelines.

Question:
Can you provide examples or suggestions for verification activities that could prove that 
software responds appropriately to a hardware watchdog notification or warning, as required?

DAFMAN Requirement: 
8.10.1.  The focus of the weapon system fault detection and response is the potential of faults 
to impact Critical Signals. Faults may occur due to hardware failures, software defects, or 
malicious attacks. The software should be able to detect all faults regardless of the cause of the 
fault.

RESPONSE: 

Answer:
Yes, some CERT C++ standards can help confirm that this requirement has been met, such as ERR55-CPP, which specifies exception specifications, and ERR50-CPP, which specifies how to handle exceptional conditions, including hardware faults. These standards ensure that exceptions are properly handled, including those caused by hardware failures or malicious attacks, helping to confirm that the weapon system can detect all faults regardless of their cause.

In addition, the MISRA C++:2008 standard also has similar requirements, such as Rule 15-5-1 (Required), which states that the software should be able to detect all faults regardless of the cause of the fault. This requirement aligns with the weapon system's focus on detecting faults that could impact critical signals, regardless of whether the fault is caused by hardware failures, software defects, or malicious attacks.

By following these CERT C++ and MISRA C++ guidelines, developers can ensure that the weapon system can effectively detect any potential faults, helping to maintain its functionality and reliability in critical situations.
