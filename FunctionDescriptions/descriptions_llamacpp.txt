scpp::reduce_vector


    The given C++ code defines a function called reduce_vector that takes two arguments: a standard library vector of elements of type T and the number of steps to perform the reduction. It returns a new vector containing only some of the original vector's elements after reducing them by taking every step-th element from the original vector and appending it to the new one. This operation is performed repeatedly, up to the given number of steps. No external libraries are used in this code.
   
    The main function initializes a standard library vector of integers as an example and passes it and a specific number of reduction steps as arguments to the reduce_vector function. The result of calling the function is stored in a new variable that's then printed using the standard library's cout. No further user input or output is expected.

scpp::expMovingAverage


    Double variable expMovingAverage calculates an exponential moving average for a given newValue based on a specified period and previousAverage value. The formula used is based on a weighted average of the previousAverage and the newValue, with a factor determined by the period and 1. The result is returned as the new exponentially-weighted average. No other information about dependencies or classes are provided in this function.

scpp::reduce_vector

    Here's an example:
    
    The given C++ code presents a function named "reduce_vector" that reduces a vector of type T by steps. It accepts a const reference to the input vector and the number of steps. The size of the reduced vector is calculated based on the size of the input vector and the number of steps. A new std::vector object is created and filled with elements from the original vector. This function returns the newly created vector.

scpp::expMovingAverage

    Example: 
    A simple moving average calculation is performed in this C++ function named expMovingAverage. It takes three arguments: a previous moving average value (called "previousAverage"), a period for which to calculate the moving average (not used here), and a new value to calculate the current moving average with. The function returns the updated value of the moving average, with a factor determined by dividing two and the sum of one and the period provided as arguments.
